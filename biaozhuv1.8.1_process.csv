[04:22:27 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: Hi Abigail<br />
[04:22:29 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: Yes I am here<br />
[04:22:54 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: I had a few questions about an issue with my Motorola Droid Turbo<br />
[04:22:55 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: 2<br />
[04:23:10 PM]Abigail: May I know what is it?<br />
[04:23:40 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: Yes. It is a known issue where a green line appears down the middle of the screen (which has now progressed to be many green lines).<br />
[04:23:51 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: It seems to be a highly reported issue with this phone<br />
[04:25:50 PM]Abigail: I am sorry to know about the green line issue for droid turbo 2 but let me check the details here for you.<br />
[04:26:29 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: Sure<br />
[04:27:33 PM]Abigail: One moment then please.<br />
[04:29:29 PM]Abigail: I am still checking my resources here. One moment again please.<br />
[04:30:24 PM]Abigail: If you look across the entire industry you will see occasional cases like this. The important thing is how companies respond. We rapidly addressed the design issue and are working with affected customers to replace or repair their units under warranty.<br />
[04:31:37 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: Yes I understand and saw you had an option to send the phone in for refurbishment or have a refurbished one delivered<br />
[04:31:54 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: I just wanted to make sure it is a known defect as opposed to being a paid repair<br />
[04:32:24 PM]Abigail: I am sorry but it is not a refurbished one but a like new one.<br />
[04:33:00 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: ok that is fine as well<br />
[04:33:37 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: I guess my question is will the replacement be free (other than the $25 or so cost to send the like new one)<br />
[04:33:48 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: or will there be a charge for the defect phone<br />
[04:34:26 PM]Abigail: There would a security hold but this one will be refunded by the time we receive the defective device.<br />
[04:35:22 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: ok great<br />
[04:35:42 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: So in that case I will go ahead and place the order for the replacement unit on the Motorola website<br />
[04:35:44 PM]Abigail: Would there be anything else that I can assist you with?<br />
[04:35:46 PM]JONATHAN MAGUIRE: if that is correct<br />
[04:36:55 PM]Abigail: You can give us a call in this number 1-800-734-5870 to process you a advance exchange or you can also do the online repair.<br />

[07:38:08 PM] Adonis: Hmmm

[07:38:28 PM] Adonis: What are the consequences of this?
[07:39:10 PM] Meruga: Boot loader unlock will not effect your device it will effect the device warranty.
[07:39:37 PM] Meruga: If you want to lock it again you can do it by sending the device for repair.

[07:41:23 PM] Adonis: Oh that&#39;s sounds good
[07:41:35 PM] Adonis: How do I root?
[07:42:20 PM] Meruga: Root means you are removing the device factory settings and uploading other factory.
[07:42:32 PM] Meruga: Which may lead to device brick.
[07:42:44 PM] Meruga: So we do not recommend that.
[07:42:44 PM] Adonis: What? Is a brick?

[07:44:27 PM] Meruga: It was not even repairable too.
[07:44:41 PM] Adonis: Interesting
[07:45:34 PM] Adonis: Can I get a replacement if my device is bricked?
[07:46:29 PM] Meruga: I am sorry Adonis, As I said it will not come under warranty and it is not repairable too.
[07:46:48 PM] Meruga: In clear our repair team will not accept that device.
[07:47:03 PM] Meruga: So you will not get replacement.
[07:47:20 PM] Adonis: Interesting loop hole
[07:47:41 PM] Adonis: Anyway is rooting worth it?
[07:48:44 PM] Meruga: If you do rooting successfully then it is Adonis.
[07:49:31 PM] Adonis: Okay also is their a big chance that my device will be bricked?
[07:50:17 PM] Meruga: Actually it depends on the tool you are using to do rooting Adonis.
[07:50:59 PM] Adonis: What do you mean there are multiple was to root?

[08:02:31 PM] Meruga: If there is no exchange of messages within 2 minutes the chat session will be closed automatically.
[08:02:41 PM] Adonis: I mean if the bootloader prevents me from rooting I assume its a factory setting that prevents me from rooting thus when I take it off I can root
[08:03:18 PM] Meruga: It depends on the carrier Adonis.
[08:03:48 PM] Meruga: Some of the carrier will not allow the device to unlock the boot loader.
[08:04:05 PM] Meruga: For that we need to contact &nbsp;the carrier.
[08:04:11 PM] Adonis: My carrier is boost Mobile do you know anything about that?
[08:04:56 PM] Meruga: Please follow the instruction in the above link.
[08:05:16 PM] Adonis: Okay so this is good bye then?

[08:05:45 PM] Adonis: Okay and if it isn&#39;t?
[08:06:03 PM] Meruga: Then please contact your carrier.
[08:06:04 PM] Adonis: Do I have to use a computer?

[02:54:17 PM] Kenneth: United States back in 2014
[02:57:32 PM] Garimella: I inform you that you can perform the unlock bootloader to your device. If you unlock bootloader to the device warranty of the device voids.
[02:58:08 PM] Kenneth: okay are you sure because in the past this Bootloader for the phone has been unable to be unlocked
[03:00:11 PM] Garimella: Did you tried to unlock the bootloader with this current device ?
[03:01:19 PM] Kenneth: I tried in the past and was unable to do it. I went online to check to see if anyone else had the problem and found that the company prevented the bootloader from unlocking. I wanted to see now if there has been any changes and if we could unlock it right now
[03:01:50 PM] Kenneth: when I say I try to unlock it in the past that was back in 2014.
[03:03:33 PM] Garimella: May I know the source of purchase of the device ?

[03:09:36 PM] Kenneth: will I be able to unlock the device sometime in the future?
[03:10:23 PM] Garimella: Unlocking bootloader completely depends on the carrier, they&#39;ll give permission for few devices to perform the unlocking bootloader.
[03:11:18 PM] Kenneth: so if the carrier discontinues the device will they usually allow the bootloader to be unlocked or does it vary?
[03:12:09 PM] Garimella: I suggest you to contact the carrier for further assistance.

[05:08:51 PM] Khaja: Okay.
[05:09:20 PM] maria: That diagram is not my phone...my phone has 2 SIM side by side...on the opposite is another slot with a card in it...perhaps thats the SD card?
[05:11:17 PM] Khaja: Okay, just to confirm again. please explore the below link which will guide you:--

[05:11:23 PM] Khaja: Please check with it and then let me know.
[05:11:42 PM] maria: okay it fit in...now I must enter the unlock code
[05:12:44 PM] Khaja: That&#39;s good and as you are referring about unlock code so in that case you need to contact your carrier so that they&#39;ll provide you a code which you need to enter in that section which will unlock your carrier.
[05:12:46 PM] Khaja: Okay.
[05:13:14 PM] Khaja: By which you&#39;ll be able to use your phone.
[05:13:52 PM] maria: i have the code and am working on putting it into their website now
[05:14:14 PM] Khaja: Sure..
[05:14:23 PM] Khaja: Please do!
[05:15:12 PM] Khaja: Based on this conversation, this is the help you were looking. Is there anything else I can help you with?
[05:16:11 PM] maria: the site is showing advertisingments
[05:16:32 PM] Khaja: May I know that about which site are you referring about?
[05:16:59 PM] maria: i think i have the site now...
[05:17:12 PM] Khaja: May I know that about which site are you referring about??
[05:17:58 PM] maria: the one sat&amp;t text to me earlier with my unlock code
[05:19:50 PM] maria: okay i thin i have a problem in that the site is saying that I should power off the phone and insert the other SIM card which I had already done...but then it says I would be prompted to enter the code once I powered on again and I was not prompted when I powered on?
[05:20:47 PM] Khaja: Okay, I would suggest you to restart your phone and then check.
[05:21:27 PM] maria: /it is not giving me ad option...and i think that the Euopean card will not come out of slot
[05:21:44 PM] Khaja: However, Unlocking the carriers are not from our end as we do not have access towards networks so I would suggest you to contact your carrier so that they&#39;ll assist you further in a better way..
[05:22:21 PM] maria: it is smaller than the one that is alongside of it but the european card fit inside perfectly
[05:22:56 PM] Khaja: Okay.
[05:23:00 PM] Khaja: Is there anything else I may assist you with?
[05:23:40 PM] maria: no...i thank you for your assistance...sorry for taking up so much time.

[01:32:20 PM] Robert: When I tried downloading data from the SD card in the MTP mode I was able to download only 2,65MB, and in the PTP mode only 24,9 - but when I look at the data on my SD card, there&#39;s much more than that.
[01:33:57 PM] SaiKiran: Follow the below instructions after installing the latest version of Windows Media Player:

1. &nbsp;Remove the USB cable from your Motorola device.
2. &nbsp;Restart the computer and allow a few minutes for the computer to power up completely.
3. &nbsp;Power the Motorola device off and then back on.
4. &nbsp;Connect the device to the USB Cable.
5. &nbsp;After the device is connected, the system should recognize the connection and you will see that the device is connected on your task bar. &nbsp;Please allow a few minutes for the computer to recognize the device.
[01:34:37 PM] SaiKiran: Are you able to see the device data in the PC?
[01:34:50 PM] Robert: Where can I find that information?
[01:35:35 PM] Robert: Oh, you mean that when I&#39;m in My Computer I have an external memory called &quot;XT1068&quot;?
[01:36:19 PM] SaiKiran: Yes
[01:36:53 PM] SaiKiran: By clicking on the device model number are you able to see all the data of the SD card?
[01:38:24 PM] Robert: Well, yes, but I see different data I think, depending whether I&#39;m in the MTP or PTP mode
[01:38:57 PM] SaiKiran: The data will be from both the SD card and the device.
[01:39:05 PM] Robert: Plus, even though I see a lot of data on my SD card, once I try to copy it on to my computer it&#39;s like only a fraction is copied.
[01:39:48 PM] SaiKiran: I suggest you to copy the data which you want to move to the NEW SD card from the OLD SD card.
[01:40:39 PM] SaiKiran: Once I suggest you to &nbsp;check the copied data.
[01:41:40 PM] SaiKiran: Are we connected?
[01:41:45 PM] Robert: Yes
[01:42:19 PM] Robert: But how do I copy it if, let&#39;s say I see 20 folders on my SD card, but when I try to copy it to my PC only 1 folder is copied
[01:42:52 PM] Robert: And not even in full
[01:43:36 PM] SaiKiran: I suggest you to copy the folder one by one.
[01:45:32 PM] Robert: Is that a problem you came across before?
[01:46:41 PM] SaiKiran: No, But I suggest you to copy the one folder and paste,And after that check whether the folder is copied or not.
[01:47:58 PM] Robert: Ok, let me try it
[01:48:24 PM] SaiKiran: Okay, Try with that and let me know.
[01:51:26 PM] Robert: Ok, in the meantime could you be so kind as to also give me a step by step information on backing up my data from my phone and then how to do a factory reset?
[01:52:01 PM] SaiKiran: Have you copied all the stuff from the device to PC?
[01:53:45 PM] SaiKiran: Are we connected?
[01:53:49 PM] Robert: yes
[01:53:54 PM] Robert: We are connected
[01:54:58 PM] Robert: No, unfortunately not all my data was copied. For example, on my SD card, the folder named &quot;Android&quot; has over 200 MB, but when I try to copy it, only 7 MB gets copied
[01:56:42 PM] SaiKiran: I suggest you that,those files are the system files,That files could not be copied.I suggest you to copy the data which are not preloaded.
[01:58:13 PM] Robert: Let&#39;s say I have my Whatsapp data on my SD card, is there anyway I can move it back to my phone storage?
[01:58:56 PM] Robert: I know that there used to be (I moved a lot of apps&#39; data from my phone to my SD card) but now, after updating to Marshmallow, I can&#39;t find it anymore.
[02:01:40 PM] SaiKiran: I would like to inform you that,we do not have the information regarding the whatsapp,The backing up of the whatsapp data will totally depends upon the permissions,I suggest you to get contact with the whatsapp developer to know about your concern regarding the whatsapp application.
[02:03:21 PM] Robert: Yes, I understand, but generally speaking, on the Lollipop you could move data from your phone onto your SD card. How do you do that in Marshmallow?
[02:06:00 PM] SaiKiran: The SD card settings have changed after updating to marshmallow.I suggest you to please go through the link to know much information about the SD card in marshmallow.

[02:17:04 PM] Robert: So... after copying my data from my OLD SD card should I format it?
[02:17:08 PM] Robert: The old one?
[02:18:31 PM] SaiKiran: I suggest you that,After copying the data from the OLD SD card to PC, keep the OLD SD card a side and check whether the data is copied into the PC.
[02:19:36 PM] Robert: Should I &#39;eject&#39; my old SD card before removing it?
[02:19:54 PM] Robert: And should I turn off my phone before removing the old sd card?

[02:27:38 PM] Robert: internal
[02:28:56 PM] SaiKiran: Doing the SD card as Internal,sometimes the card is not readable by other devices. (another phone, Mac, PC, digital camera)
[02:30:07 PM] SaiKiran: I suggest you to go through the link which I provided you earlier,There you will be having all the information about the SD card as internal and portable storage.

[08:26:17 PM] ted: I have downloaded drivers fo OSX 10.1106 for file transfer via USB to my G4+. However, phone will not mount and drivers don't seem to worlk.
[08:27:44 PM] ted: I have even tried different ports as electrical capacity can affect some drivers.
[08:28:24 PM] ted: I downloaded the drivers from Motorola directly also, not a secondary ompany or site.
[08:28:49 PM] Rajesh: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this
[08:28:58 PM] Rajesh:
Could you please provide me the IMEI number of the phone?
You can get that number from the box of the device, by dialing *#06# or by going through the settings> about phone>status> IMEI.
[08:30:26 PM] ted: 358184070398045
[08:30:42 PM] Rajesh: Thank you for providing the information.
[08:31:05 PM] Rajesh: As I understand that you are unable to connect your device to Mac, am I correct?
[08:31:59 PM] ted: It used to connect via Android File Transfer but that became really wonky and then STOPPEd completely from working. I researched added methods and Motorola had drivers. Those drivers don't seem to work?
[08:33:21 PM] Rajesh: Let me inform you that you need to have the Android transfer tool to transfer your files from phone to PC.
[08:33:55 PM] Rajesh: Please explore the following and select &quot;Mac&quot;

https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/utils/prod_guided_assistant/g_id/5729/p/30,6720,9686/#gs=
[08:34:23 PM] Rajesh: You will have the procedure to transfer the files in the above link.
[08:34:31 PM] ted: That was not an option that I was able to find. I am not worried about getting files from phone to Mac,I need to get music onto phone.
[08:35:08 PM] ted: Regardless, the phone will not mount to the Mac. It doesn't even see it as an option.
[08:35:59 PM] ted: I am not running itunes in my moto g. Can itunes even work on android?
[08:37:00 PM] Rajesh: Please open the above link, And select &quot;Mac&quot; and after that select &quot;Music&quot;

There you will find the steps to transfer the music with the screenshots.
[08:38:14 PM] ted: Ummm... there is no acknoledgement of the Moto g even mouting on my mac. I can't put files in a place that doesn't exist.
[08:38:49 PM] Rajesh: Have you enabled USB debugging option in your phone?
[08:39:10 PM] ted: Not sure what that is.
[08:39:57 PM] ted: And the USB drivers page from motorola didn't mention it.
[08:40:23 PM] Rajesh: Ok, Please follow the below steps.

On your phone,
Go to settings>>about phone>>tap on built number 7 times back to back.

Then go back to settings>>developer options>>USB debugging.
[08:40:38 PM] Rajesh: Then try connecting the phone to PC.
[08:41:59 PM] ted: It says I am a developer, however, MY MAC is still ot showing the phone connected inn any way.
[08:42:21 PM] ted: I have a MAC NOT &nbsp;PC - IN CAASE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE AS YOU KEEP SAYING PC.
[08:43:02 PM] Rajesh: I am sorry! I meant say MAC when I'm saying PC.
[08:43:47 PM] ted: No worries. I just didn't want to get instructions for one not hte other.
[08:44:48 PM] Rajesh: Have you enabled the USEB debugging option?
[08:44:54 PM] Rajesh: *USB
[08:45:13 PM] ted: Yes. Tapped 7 tomes, it said I am now a developer.
[08:45:53 PM] Rajesh: Now go back to settings>>developer options>>enable USB debugging option.
[08:46:33 PM] ted: done
[08:46:55 PM] Rajesh: Now connect your phone with your MAC.
[08:47:00 PM] ted: Still not mounting phone
[08:48:30 PM] Rajesh: Have you downloaded the Mac File Transfer tool on your MAC?
[08:49:07 PM] ted: Yes, I did that befoer I contacted you. However, it seems to have disapeared in my mac and I don't know where it went
[08:50:52 PM] ted: If you can send me the USB driver link for OSX again, I'll try to down load it again
[08:51:02 PM] Rajesh: Alright, I suggest you to install Mac File Transfer tool at http://www.android.com/filetransfer
[08:51:42 PM] Rajesh: Then from the applications folder click on the Android File Transfer application.

After that plug the supplied USB cable into the phone and then plug the USB into the Mac. The Android File Transfer tool will automatically recognize the device is connected and it will pop up the file folder.
[08:51:57 PM] ted: Ok. AFT was the program that didn't work earlier, keeps locking up and will not acknowledge that the phone is mounted. Keeps saying the screnn is locked and will not moiunt
[08:52:36 PM] Rajesh: Make sure that your phone is unlocked when you connect your phone to MAC.
[08:52:50 PM] ted: And I also deleted it and reinstalled it in case that was the problem.
[08:53:44 PM] ted: So, I just got a pop up window with a radio button selevtion to &quot;select USB configration&quot; and chose MTP fpor mac and it now works. How do I not have to have this issue in the future?
[08:55:57 PM] Rajesh: You will not face the same issue again. If you have the issue again, then go to settings>>developer option>>USB configuration >>Select &quot;MTP&quot;
[08:56:34 PM] ted: Actually, when I unplug it, and plug it back in, it makes me select MTP each time so I am fine with that. thanks

Please go to Settings > About phone > Status > IMEI/MEID information. Or if you still have the box of the phone, kindly locate for the IMEI/MEID that normally starts with 99000, 35 or A000.<br />
[01:31:06 PM]Madison Gassion: so you guys don't have no time frame?<br />
[01:31:07 PM]Madison Gassion: oh ok<br />
[01:31:17 PM]Madison Gassion: Madison Gassion madskills384@yahoo.com<br />
[01:31:21 PM]Madison Gassion: and the IMEI number is<br />
[01:31:49 PM]Madison Gassion: 358180070945405<br />
[01:32:22 PM]Madison Gassion: phone number is 925-584-2991<br />
[01:32:41 PM]HH_Elmar: Thank you for providing that. And may I know as well your carrier.<br />
[01:33:08 PM]Madison Gassion: t-mobile<br />
[01:33:32 PM]HH_Elmar: Thank you.<br />
[01:33:48 PM]Madison Gassion: are you able to push the update to my phone?<br />
[01:33:56 PM]HH_Elmar: One moment please. Let me check it here.<br />
[01:34:23 PM]Madison Gassion: ok<br />
[01:36:05 PM]HH_Elmar: Upon checking, there can be dependencies on carriers and other key partners that will take more time (certifications, independent testing or requests for additional changes).  This is why sometimes you will see an upgrade for a device model go to one group of users, but take significantly longer to get to another - even in the same region.<br />
[01:36:43 PM]HH_Elmar: The best thing to do is to ask your carrier for the availability of the software upgrade.<br />
[01:36:48 PM]Madison Gassion: ok but this is the unlocked version why does it matter the carrier? I could also use it on at&t<br />
[01:37:04 PM]Madison Gassion: the update doesn't come from them on an unlocked phone...<br />
[01:37:23 PM]Madison Gassion: this isn't a tmobile specific phone<br />
[01:38:59 PM]HH_Elmar: Carriers can also decide when they can push the update on your phone. And Motorola and carriers providing the updates by batch according to their region and specifications<br />
[01:40:28 PM]Madison Gassion: I don't understand, how would a carrier stop an unlock phone? What if I was just on Wifi and not a carrier how would it get an update? I see on the verizon specfic models you have but you guys don't even offer a tmobile moto z just an unlocked one that can be used on gsm carriers<br />
[01:41:48 PM]HH_Elmar: I am sorry for the inconvenience. May I know where did you purchase the device?<br />
[01:42:36 PM]Madison Gassion: amazon its the same as if I purchased it form motorola.com its an unlocked phone no carrier tied to it<br />
[01:43:33 PM]HH_Elmar: I see.<br />
[01:44:18 PM]Madison Gassion: you guys only offer either the unlocked version or the Verizon version in either case tmobile has nothing to do with it<br />
[01:44:27 PM]Madison Gassion: just using the phone on the service<br />
[01:45:36 PM]HH_Elmar: Just to make sure please check from time to time if you will receive an update since we do not have the time frame for the updates of unlocked phones.<br />
[01:45:47 PM]HH_Elmar: Sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
[01:46:09 PM]Madison Gassion: ok so your saying you have no idea when the update will be pushed out?<br />
[01:47:28 PM]HH_Elmar: Yes, because still it will depends on partners and deve", I just purchase the Moto Z unlocked version and I still don't have android nougat or 7 yet to download when will that be available? I believe the Verizon versions already got it.,H11.1.2, i just purchase the moto z unlocked version and i still don't have android nougat or 7 yet to download when will that be available  i believe the verizon versions already got it , purchase moto z unlocked version don't android nougat download available believe verizon versions got, i just purchase the moot z unlocked version and i still don't have android nougat or 7 yet to download when will that be available i believe the Verizon versions already got it

[02:08:08 PM]pooja: it says that ""your device's software is up to date""<br />

I suggest you to please explore the above link and enter your device model and carrier and check for the upgrade.
[01:33:05 PM] ALEX RACHTCHININE: I saw that - it does not make sense. This article says &quot;This device will remain on Android 5.1 (Lollipop)&quot; but I already have 6.0 from the moment I bought it.
[01:37:18 PM] Shirisha: As per the site the device remains on lollipop. As you already received your device with Marshmallow we do not have any information about 6.1. If we have any information about that we will be happy to assist you.
[01:38:31 PM] ALEX RACHTCHININE: Google released 6.1 last year and I have Pure Edition version, so what you are telling me does not make sense
[01:39:43 PM] Shirisha: I understand your concern, But i don&#39;t want to give any false commitment or information to you. Once it is official announced, we will be happy to assist you. I hope you will understand it.

[03:46:49 PM] Vijith: Thank you for being on hold.
[03:47:01 PM] Sarah: thank you, any luck?
[03:49:08 PM] Vijith: May I know the Carrier options which you have been selected while purchase the device in the website?
[03:49:45 PM] Sarah: on the website they purchased it as they did not need a SIM card so they didn&#39;t choose a carrier. &nbsp;They used AARP
[03:51:37 PM] Vijith: Thank you for providing the information.
[03:51:54 PM] Sarah: no problem

[01:22:20 PM] Ben: I have contacted the carrier and they won&#39;t give me an unlock code. Is there anyway you can give me a code since you are with the motorola company?
[01:23:21 PM] Chintakindi: I am sorry Ben, Motorola does not provide any codes to unlock the devices, it can only possible from carrier end.
[01:24:10 PM] Ben: I thought motorola locked the phones? Is it the carrier that locks the phones?
[01:25:18 PM] Chintakindi: The carrier can lock the phone to use their particular network. Motorola made contract with the carriers but will not lock the devices.
[01:25:53 PM] Ben: Alright... thank you.
[01:25:57 PM] Chintakindi: Verizon might have unlocked your device to use with US carriers only, please contact them and explain the situation once.

[08:35:28 PM]Sean Smithey: HI Arvin<br />
[08:36:17 PM]Sean Smithey: I have a dilema.  I returned my Motorola Z-Force to Motorola today for repair (under warranty).  The RMA number is 170116-001384.<br />
[08:36:55 PM]Arvin: What is it?<br />
[08:37:35 PM]Sean Smithey: Driving in from work tonight, it dawned on me that I followed the instructions to a tee - with the exception of removing my 200 GB SD Card with all of photos and files, and as well, did not remove the SIM Card.<br />
[08:38:16 PM]Sean Smithey: I am usually meticulous about things like this, but for some reason, I failed to do this.  So the phone will be retuned with the SD Card and SIM Card still in their respective slots.<br />
[08:38:22 PM]Sean Smithey: Is there anything I can do?<br />
[08:38:38 PM]Arvin: I'm so sorry for that inconvenience that you are not able to remove the SD card and SIM card on your device. Let me go ahead and assist you with that.<br />
[08:39:28 PM]Arvin: Unfortunately, it will not be returned back to you.<br />

[08:40:51 PM]Sean Smithey: Lots of memories and sentimental pictures on the SD card.  Will the card be destroyed?<br />
[08:40:59 PM]Arvin: As much as I wanted to help you, Sean, but the only thing I can help you is with the SIM card. You can contact your Carrier or Service Provider for the replacement.<br />
[08:41:45 PM]Sean Smithey: Yes - I can go to the local Verizon Store and get a new SIM Card - but my SD Card is the most important piece to me.  Unfortunately, I am out of luck and it is gone forever.<br />
[08:43:00 PM]Sean Smithey: I caused this problem - will just have to accept the fact I made the mistake and have now lost very important data.<br />
[08:43:05 PM]Arvin: I am sorry if that happened to you, Sean, that you are not able to remove those accessories.<br />
[08:43:46 PM]Arvin: But the instructions are indicated with the email we sent to you.<br />
[08:44:36 PM]Sean Smithey: Oh- I knew how to remove them - have done it many, many times.  I was just in a hurry to get it returned so the repair process could begin and I could get my phone back.  I am currently without a phone - work in healthcare - and it is very important my patients be able to get in touch with me.  I was thinking so rapidly about getting it repaired that it totally slipped my mind to remove the SD Card and the SIM Card.<br />
[08:45:05 PM]Sean Smithey: Yes - I know - i read them.   I accept full respon<br />
[08:45:33 PM]Arvin: As much as I wanted to resolve this but there is nothing I can do with that, Sean.<br />
[08:45:44 PM]Arvin: It is the process for our repair.<br />
[08:46:11 PM]Sean Smithey: I accept full responsibility for this happening.  It is no one's fault but my own.  I am not trying to blame anyone, was just looking for an option that might allow me to notify someone and they could make sure they are returned.  Since that is not the case, I will just chalk it up to a lesson learned.<br />
[08:47:17 PM]Sean Smithey: The phone was returned today- supposedly overnight.  I was told by a previous rep that the intent of the repair center is to have the phone repaired and back to the customer within 3-5 business days.  I am just lost without a phone.<br />
[08:47:30 PM]Arvin: Thank you for understanding the process, Sean.<br />
[08:48:43 PM]Sean Smithey: The package is scheduled to arrive by 3 p.m. tomorrow.  Will I be kept up to date as the process begins and when I can expect to receive the phone back?<br />

[01:26:15 PM]Andrew: Hi, I just had a quick question about the Moto Z play that you sell direct and unlocked.<br />
[01:26:38 PM]Arvin: Sure, what is it, Andrew?<br />
[01:27:40 PM]Andrew: For the Moto Z Play sold from Motorola, is it model XT1635-02. the carrier I want to bring to says it needs to be that specific model. Thanks<br />
[01:28:23 PM]Arvin: I'm so sorry for that inconvenience that you are not able to know the Carrier compatibility of the device. Let me go ahead and assist you with that.<br />
[01:28:33 PM]Andrew: Thanks<br />
[01:29:28 PM]Arvin: Moto Z Play is unlocked for AT&T, T-Mobile, and compatible GSM networks so you can switch carriers and keep your phone. Just simply swap SIM cards. Sprint not supported.<br />
[01:29:54 PM]Andrew: How about Republic Wireless?<br />
[01:30:45 PM]Arvin: Let me check that one for you.<br />
[01:30:53 PM]Andrew: I 'heard' they us T Mobile, but they can't officially state which GSM carrier they  use. But when I talked  to their support , they said Republic Wireless should be able to use Moto Z play if it's model XT1635-02. So I want to make sure before I buy.<br />
[01:31:15 PM]Andrew: And your website doens't list the model number. Thanks<br />
[01:32:45 PM]Arvin: Upon checking, Moto Z Play will not work in Republic Wireless.<br />
[01:32:49 PM]Andrew: Your website states ""no"" for Republic Wireless, but I think they just added  that phone, so maybe you haven't updated your website.  But Republic does states it will work if for model XT1635-02 US model.<br />
[01:33:05 PM]Andrew: Are you sure? Their website states otherwise.<br />
[01:33:18 PM]Andrew: I just need to know the model number. Can you give me the model number?<br />
[01:33:42 PM]Arvin: For your reference, you can visit this link <a href=""https://www.motorola.com/us/carrier-compatibility"" target=""_blank"">https://www.motorola.com/us/carrier-compatibility</a>.<br />

[01:37:10 PM]Arvin: One moment please.<br />
[01:37:15 PM]Andrew: Thank you.<br />
[01:38:18 PM]Arvin: Still pulling up my resources.<br />
[01:38:25 PM]Andrew: I guess it's not model number, but the SKU number: XT1635-02 actually<br />
[01:40:03 PM]Arvin: Do you have the device right now? Or you will just place an order?<br />
[01:40:45 PM]Arvin: Because the Model Number can be only show in a specific device.<br />
[01:40:50 PM]Andrew: I don't have the device. I'm thinking of buying it from your website, but before I do, i want to make sure it's the correct one from your websit. Thanks.<br />
[01:41:15 PM]Andrew: Oh, I see.....<br />
[01:41:32 PM]Arvin: Yes, Andrew.<br />
[01:41:35 PM]Andrew: MotoZ Play is relatively new phone ,right? Has there only been one generation?<br />
[01:41:43 PM]Andrew: Or is there a second generation already?<br />
[01:41:57 PM]Arvin: Yes, it is the first.<br />
[01:41:55 PM]Andrew: If it's just one generation, then it has to be the same one<br />
[01:42:24 PM]Andrew: And you aren't selling any other newer (2nd or later) generations on your website. Is that correct?<br />
[01:42:45 PM]Arvin: Yes, but regarding the Model Number, it will only be shown through the device.<br />
[01:44:16 PM]Andrew: Hmm... That's a little frustrating if a person can never find out the SKU number when buying unlocked phone until after they get it.  This would be my first exp buying an unlocked phone. What is your return policy in case it happens to have the wrong SKU number? I think that's unlikely, but just in case.<br />
[01:45:04 PM]Arvin: We have 14 business days upon receiving the device.<br />

[07:32:23 PM]Zacharias: Hi Anna. I am in need of a Moto factory image.<br />
[07:32:55 PM]Anna: Hi Zacharias, I'm sorry to know that you are having a problem in downloading or having the factory image.<br />
[07:33:23 PM]Anna: May I ask where are you trying to get the Moto Factory Image?<br />
[07:34:07 PM]Zacharias: From your own very website: <a href=""https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/recovery-images"" target=""_blank"">https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/recovery-images</a>.

[07:36:30 PM]Zacharias: Unfortunately, this is quite dire because my phone is in a bootloop. I remember once getting an email from Moto that contained a recovery image. Is there no way to send it through other methods?<br />
[07:37:47 PM]Anna: I'm afraid to say at this time I have no information about other methods, if you would like you can contact us 1-800-734-5870, to check with our Level 2 Support, if there is other methods.<br />
[07:40:59 PM]Anna: Hi Zacharias,  I noticed you have been away from the chat session for 2 minutes. I’ll stay here until the next minute so I can continue to help you with your concern.<br />
[07:42:03 PM]Zacharias: There's no possible way to access the recovery files and simply send them to me?<br />
[07:42:53 PM]Anna: I'm sorry Zacharias, but since I only have limited information here in my end, we don't have any way other method.<br />

188,8935081,Moto G (4th Gen.),Carrier Issues,"[09:09:54 PM] Hi, my name is Wankhadae. How may I help you?
[09:10:20 PM] Christian: Hey, I just got my new Moto G4, and I&#39;m trying to activate it
[09:11:18 PM] Christian: I&#39;ve been with Boost Mobile, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be working, I called them, and they said it won&#39;t work with their service. I was just wondering if I could get some more information about why.
[09:12:30 PM] Wankhadae: I understand your concern and I can certainly assist you with this.
[09:12:51 PM] Wankhadae: I would like to inform you that the Moto G4 is a unlocked device.
[09:13:26 PM] Wankhadae: You can use any sim in the device.
[09:15:38 PM] Christian: Yeah, that was my understanding. I have my boost sim. I can put it in my old phone and it works fine(Also a motorola)
[09:17:26 PM] Christian: I&#39;m willing to switch carriers for this, but I believe it will actually work fine, and I&#39;ve just been getting some bad information
[09:17:58 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to insert the sim in your device and check Christian.
[09:18:26 PM] Christian: I did, it hasn&#39;t worked so far.
[09:19:03 PM] Wankhadae: While purchasing the device have you choose any carrier for the device?
[09:19:34 PM] Christian: It just seems to hang on trying to register on the sprint network. I think I could simply input my own APN data if I could just bypass the automatic configuration.
[09:20:31 PM] Wankhadae: Yes you can use the sprint network.
[09:21:20 PM] Christian: While trying to configure the network it even flashes the LTE logo and momentarily works before telling me it&#39;s failed to configure.
[09:22:40 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to contact the carrier they will help you with the settings.
[09:23:14 PM] Christian: I already did, and they didn&#39;t. They just told me it&#39;s impossible and the phone won&#39;t work on their network.
[09:24:56 PM] Wankhadae: Have you inserted the sprint sim in your device?
[09:25:34 PM] Christian: Yep. It tries to configure, it goes through 5 retries, and each time if briefly works. For about one second.
[09:26:38 PM] Wankhadae: The sprint said that the sim also does not work with them.
[09:28:18 PM] Christian: Well, I can still just put it my other phone and it works fine. It seems verifiably usable on their network.
[09:28:51 PM] Wankhadae: It seems to be an issue with the sim slot of the device.
[09:29:38 PM] Wankhadae: May I know when you have purchased with the device?
[09:29:53 PM] Christian: Yesterday. It arrived probably 4 hours ago.
[09:30:08 PM] Wankhadae: May i know the source of purchase?
[09:30:31 PM] Christian: Amazon
[09:31:25 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to contact them and you can return the device and order a new device Christian.
[09:31:42 PM] Wankhadae: There is 15 day return from Motorola website.
[09:33:36 PM] Christian: Alright, but I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a hardware problem. I&#39;m going to do a little more looking into it before I resort to that. The lack of ability to manually input APN settings, seems to be related to the automatic carrier setup.
[09:35:32 PM] Christian: Boost sims have 2 built in APN profiles, one for Boost and one for Sprint, which they seem to be able to use interchangeably. It&#39;s clearly using the Sprint one by default when it tries to automatically configure, so if I can I&#39;m going to see if I can switch that to the boost one. As far as you know, has anyone gotten this phone to work on Boost?
[09:37:26 PM] Wankhadae: We come across the situation very rarely this chat is related to the carrier so we redirect the customers to carrier.
[09:37:44 PM] Wankhadae: They will help with the settings and they are good with the network.
[09:38:22 PM] Christian: Alright. That hasn&#39;t been my experience with Boost, but perhaps I&#39;ll try with sprint.
[09:38:59 PM] Christian: If it doesn&#39;t work out I&#39;ll just get a new carrier for my G4. I&#39;m not all that interested in supporting a company that&#39;s not interested in supporting me.
[09:39:19 PM] Wankhadae: Thank you for understanding Christian!
[09:39:25 PM] Wankhadae: Is there anything else I may assist you today?
[09:39:39 PM] Christian: No, but thanks for your help so far.

[12:31:36 PM] Michael: I purchased a Moto G 3 at Best Buy about a week ago. &nbsp;The back cover doesn&#39;t seem to seal around the SIM card/power/volume buttons.
[12:32:03 PM] Michael: I&#39;m wondering whether I need to return to the store or if it&#39;s possible to get a new back cover to try and fix here.
[12:32:17 PM] Wankhadae: I am sorry to hear that Michael!
[12:32:25 PM] Wankhadae: Was there any physical damage to the device?
[12:33:10 PM] Michael: No.
[12:33:33 PM] Wankhadae: As I understand the back cover of the device is not sealed. Am I right?
[12:33:39 PM] Michael: I first noticed after installing the SIM card (so there was an opening of the back cover for that)
[12:33:40 PM] Michael: That&#39;s right
[12:35:02 PM] Wankhadae: Yes there will be a small gap for opening the back cover.
[12:36:16 PM] Michael: Right, that&#39;s at the bottom left of the device (when looking at screen). &nbsp;The lack of seal feels like the case is insecure and the lip of the cover is extended slightly at the top right of the device.
[12:36:56 PM] Wankhadae: Okay then I suggest you to once visit the store and check with them Michael.
[12:37:01 PM] Wankhadae: They will help you with that.
[12:37:29 PM] Michael: That&#39;s too bad (they&#39;ll probably only be able to replace the device entirely?). &nbsp;But I can do that.
[12:37:55 PM] Wankhadae: I am sorry for the inconvenience Michael!
[12:38:10 PM] Wankhadae: May I know when did you purchase the device?
[12:38:38 PM] Michael: Last Tuesday (8/2)
[12:39:01 PM] Wankhadae: Once check with them Michael.

[12:39:28 PM] Wankhadae: We will help you with other options.
[12:39:58 PM] Wankhadae: But remember the device can be replaces or refund only if the device is within 15 days.

[05:38:43 PM] Christy: Oh, it is also only on my regular facing camera, not the front face one
[05:39:58 PM] Kagita: Okay! I am really sorry for that.
[05:40:12 PM] Christy: It&#39;s all good in the hood
[05:40:35 PM] Kagita: I suggest you to place a request for the device. There is a replacement option available for the device. You need to pay $24.99 for replacement device.

[05:43:28 PM] Kagita: I am sorry you need to be in USA or you need to provide USA address to place a repair request.
[05:43:53 PM] Kagita: You can send the device to your friends or relatives and ask them to place a repair request.

[05:46:21 PM] Christy: Okay so lets say my mom places the request from the USA. The phone comes in a few days, but I will not get home for a few months. Then what happens?
[05:47:29 PM] Kagita: The phone will be there. Your mom will ship back the old defective device to us. And you will keep the new device.
[05:47:43 PM] Christy: But I have the defective device with me in the other country
[05:48:10 PM] Kagita: You can ask your mother to ship back the new phone to Costa Rica
[05:48:48 PM] Christy: But that is what I was saying the mailing system here is not reliable. It will either get stolen or will not get to me for a few months because it is lost.
[05:48:54 PM] Kagita: The hold amount will be deducted from the card if Motorola did not receive the defective device.
[05:49:03 PM] Christy: So should I place this request when i come home?
[05:49:12 PM] Christy: Even though it is a few months from now, will you still replace it then?
[05:49:15 PM] Kagita: I am sorry! In this case I suggest you to wait till you reach USA.
[05:49:22 PM] Kagita: Yes!
[05:49:39 PM] Kagita: Please make sure there will be no damage to the device.
[05:49:54 PM] Christy: Okay, that is probably what I will do. I will be home for two weeks in december before i come back, will that be enough time for the phone to be shipped to me and mine to ship?
[05:50:02 PM] Christy: Yes, will do!
[05:50:22 PM] Kagita: Okay! Is there anything else I may assist you with today?
[05:51:00 PM] Kagita: Yes! You will receive the new device after 4 days of placing a repair request.
[05:51:07 PM] Christy: Okay sweet!
[05:51:13 PM] Christy: No maam that is all!
[05:51:15 PM] Kagita: You will have 5 days to ship the defective device back.
[05:51:30 PM] Christy: So if I come back in a few months, someone else will do this for me as nicely as you?
[05:52:29 PM] Kagita: Yes Christy.
[05:52:39 PM] Kagita: Please get back to us once you reach USA.

[10:01:24 AM] End-user: 1. The device was not registered to Motorola ID &amp; it is right now asking me the carrier name. Is that applicable for me as I have purchased the phone through Motorola website?
[10:01:55 AM] Chintakindi: May I know that you have purchased the device with carrier?
[10:02:27 AM] End-user: no. The device was unlocked. The purchase was around 22 March 2016
[10:02:38 AM] Chintakindi: Alright.
[10:03:07 AM] Chintakindi: If you are using a carrier in the device then you have to provide the carrier details to register the device.
[10:03:25 AM] End-user: in that case do I need to specify my current carrier? or should it be carrier unknown?

[10:06:25 AM] Chintakindi: I am sorry about that, there is no any free replacement of screen is available now, you need to pay the repair cost.

[01:46:48 PM]V: I've downloaded many music players and none of them have been able to locate the music on my SD card<br />
[01:47:33 PM]V: Why wouldnt Motorola just put in a preinstalled music player for the customer<br />
[01:47:46 PM]Johanna: Have you tried using the  sd card to other phone ?<br />
[01:48:37 PM]Johanna: How about the pictures  can you locate it or were you able to check the other files ?<br />
[01:48:42 PM]V: Yes I had it in a HTC desire 626 and it worked perfectly fine on that phone because it had a preinstalled music player<br />
[01:49:17 PM]V: All I have is music. I didn't have anything but music on the SD card<br />

[01:55:50 PM]V: It's just Motorola. Why wouldn't they have put in a preinstalled music player. It's pretty simple. This is the 3rd Motorola phone that I've had this problem with. I'm done with Motorola and sticking to Samsung or HTC. Maybe I'll go back to Apple. Thats something Motorola should probably apply to Thier phones. A music player<br />

[04:14:46 PM]Abigail: Hello Rachel.<br />
[04:15:15 PM]Rachel Ford: Hello I recently purchased my Motorola X Pure and I have cracked the screen. I am not sure if it is covered under any warranty through Motorola and would like to find out. I cannot add my device to my Motorola login because it is directing me to perform an action in my devices settings, which I am unable to do due to the broken screen/touch pad. I would like to see if any repairs would be covered under warranty.<br />
[04:15:23 PM]Rachel Ford: Hi Abigail thank you for your help.<br />
[04:16:28 PM]Abigail: I am sorry to know that your Moto X Pure Edition has a cracked screen but let me assist you and check that for you.<br />
[04:16:54 PM]Abigail: Can you please verify your first and last name, email address and phone number?<br />
[04:16:54 PM]Rachel Ford: I purchased my cell phone through Best Buy on October 30 2016. I did not purchase any sort of protection plan or anything like that from them, just the phone itself.<br />
[04:17:21 PM]Rachel Ford: Rachel Ford, ford.rachel1@gmail.com, 5719696039<br />
[04:17:33 PM]Abigail: Thank you for the information.<br />
[04:17:32 PM]Rachel Ford: you may have a different phone number listed but that is my most current<br />
[04:17:45 PM]Abigail: Alright, thank you.<br />
[04:17:54 PM]Rachel Ford: thank you<br />
[04:18:00 PM]Abigail: May I have also the IMEI number of the phone? Please go to Settings > About phone > Status > IMEI/MEID information. Or if you still have the box of the phone, kindly locate for the IMEI/MEID that normally starts with 99000, 35 or A000.<br />
[04:19:03 PM]Rachel Ford: Again, I am unable to access my phone settings due to the touch screen being dysfunctional. I was able to access my IMEI number through the barcodes section of the bootloader. My IMEI is 358195070818154<br />
[04:19:22 PM]Abigail: Thank you.<br />
[04:19:34 PM]Rachel Ford: Sure thing.<br />
[04:20:47 PM]Abigail: Upon checking here at my end Rachel, physical damage like cracked screen is not covered by our standard warranty.<br />
[04:21:55 PM]Abigail: If we process a repair here, there would be a repair cost.<br />
[04:22:21 PM]Rachel Ford: Certainly.<br />
[04:22:32 PM]Rachel Ford: Thank you for checking my warranty information.<br />
[04:22:45 PM]Abigail: You're welcome, would there be anything else that I can assist you with?<br />
[04:23:18 PM]Rachel Ford: Can you please inform me of downside of attempting the repair on my own? I am living in Costa Rica and it will be expensive for me to ship the phone to the US. Can I buy replacement parts through Motorola?<br />
[04:23:34 PM]Rachel Ford: (They do not repair this type of phone here since it is not a commonly used phone in this country, no Motorola phone is sadly.)<br />
[04:24:45 PM]Abigail: Unfortunately we only have a shattershield for sale in our website for our droid Turbo and for Moto Z.<br />
[04:25:06 PM]Abigail: You can check for the local repair center near your location.<br />

[07:30:55 PM] Kelly: Hello, I just got a Moto 4g and is it true it does not have a activated notification light, &nbsp;what a waste to have that in the upper corner of my new phone. I am hearing impaired and rely on that flashing light.
[07:32:06 PM] Khaja: I will certainly provide you information.
[07:32:21 PM] Khaja: In order to proceed further, May I know your device IMEI number and Email address?
[07:32:21 PM] Kelly: ok please
[07:33:31 PM] Kelly: oh dear I don't know it and I can't see it well, &nbsp;my email is badbadgers2006@hotmail.com
[07:34:01 PM] Khaja: Okay, No worries,Thank you for providing the information.
[07:34:15 PM] Kelly: ok
[07:34:22 PM] Khaja: I understand is that you wanted to know whether there's a notification light in your phone or not,Am I correct?
[07:34:30 PM] Kelly: yes
[07:35:09 PM] Khaja: I undersand your concern but notification light has been removed in high end phone and one new feature has been updated called &nbsp;&quot;Active display feature&quot;.
[07:35:19 PM] Khaja: Let me know explain you that how does it works.
[07:35:27 PM] Kelly: ok
[07:36:03 PM] Khaja: Earlier when ever you get any messages/text then at that point of time the notification light used to blink right?
[07:36:16 PM] Kelly: right
[07:36:58 PM] Khaja: So now when ever you get any messages/text right so instead of blinking the light the display of your screen will slightly wakes up in order to notify you.
[07:37:14 PM] Khaja: So shall I provide you steps inorder to enable it?
[07:37:38 PM] Kelly: yes
[07:37:42 PM] Khaja: Sure.
[07:38:07 PM] Khaja: In the main menu you'll be able to see &quot;MOTO APP&quot; so tap on it and then tap on &quot;DISPLAY&quot; And enable Display option.
[07:38:37 PM] Khaja: And from now when ever you get any notifications then your device screen will slightly wakes up.
[07:38:39 PM] Khaja: Okay.
[07:39:25 PM] Kelly: one question, how long does it stay on?
[07:41:18 PM] Khaja: It depends like under settings>>display>>you'll have an option of display time out>>so if you set it for 30 sec's then it will stay for 30 sec's and if you set more than that then it will stay on so and so time..
[07:41:48 PM] Khaja: Under settings>>display>>sleep.
[07:41:59 PM] Khaja: So under sleep you need to set time.
[07:42:12 PM] Khaja: Like 30 sec's 45 seconds or more than that.
[07:42:24 PM] Khaja: Based on your convenience.
[07:42:43 PM] Khaja: Because it completely depends on sleep time..
[07:44:22 PM] Kelly: ok, &nbsp; I sure will miss my light. &nbsp;Perhaps you can let your head honcho this is not good for the hearing impaired. &nbsp;I have two weeks to test this phone out. I might return it. &nbsp;Thank-you for your time.
[07:45:50 PM] Khaja: I'm sorry! But now in every upgrading models of Motorola the option of notification light have been removed and have been upgraded to active display.
[07:47:44 PM] Kelly: oh jeepers. &nbsp;I was so happy with my 1st generation Moto G that's why my new phone is still in the Moto G family. Oh well. &nbsp;Thank you for your help.

[02:27:02 PM] Terry: Hi i have an on going problem with Moto E 2nd gen phones
[02:27:37 PM] Wankhadae: I am sorry to hear that. Let me see how best I can resolve this for you..
[02:29:12 PM] Terry: I just received my fourth phone with in a year. Every phone i had so far has a problem with the ear speaker sound level. After about 4-6 weeks it too low to hear. Is this a problem with these phones??
[02:31:15 PM] Terry: I have the fourth phone and don'r know for sure if i want to set it up to use it or send it back for a refund and purchase another type of moto phone. No problem with my provider so far they replaced them at no cost to me.
[02:32:14 PM] Wankhadae: How long you are facing the issue Terry?
[02:33:13 PM] Terry: We went thru the normal checks and factory resetting with each phone with no avail. &nbsp; My first purchase of the moto E was mid Nov. 2015
[02:34:21 PM] Terry: Can you tell me if this is a issue with the Moto E 2nd gen?
[02:34:30 PM] Wankhadae: Was there any physical damage to the devoce?
[02:35:17 PM] Terry: Never, the phones all look new when returned. No dropping &amp; no water either.
[02:35:47 PM] Terry: Can you tell me if this is a issue with the Moto E 2nd gen?
[02:36:37 PM] Wankhadae: We had not heard this issue with the Moto E second generation.
[02:37:07 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to send your device to service center they will repair the device.
[02:37:15 PM] Terry: My provider is Consumer Cellular, no complaint with them at all.
[02:38:47 PM] Terry: The real issue is my year guarantee runs out in about three weeks. If i start up this last phone and have yet the same issue i'm stuck. Other than having the phone for a year.
[02:39:55 PM] Terry: I find it very hard to believe no one has the same problem. How can it be possible that i have three in a row. &nbsp;
[02:40:15 PM] Wankhadae: Are you using any magnetic case for your device?
[02:41:08 PM] Terry: Believe me when i say it's not me abusing the phone. No case always in my front pocket.
[02:42:09 PM] Terry: What do you suggest i do with the new phone...start it up and see what happens?
[02:43:16 PM] Terry: I know this may sound like it's something i'm doing but just think if your me and know it's not me??
[02:44:11 PM] Wankhadae: I understand how frustrating it would be Terry.
[02:44:54 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to once send the device for repair and check.
[02:45:55 PM] Terry: What recourse do i have if i use the new phone and experience the same problem...believe i hop i don't. Is there something you can do on your end with a supervisor than i could return the phone to you for checking IF thee is a problem?
[02:47:08 PM] Terry: Right now in order to to receive this last new phone under guarantee i must return the broken one back to CC.
[02:47:48 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to send the default device to the CC and use the new device.
[02:48:03 PM] Wankhadae: Can you share the IMEI of the new device?
[02:48:34 PM] Terry: SO far CC never gave me a problem with the returned phones. I ever get feed back fron them other than the replacement is covered under the guarantee.
[02:49:57 PM] Terry: I can give you my current IMEI but i need to turn on the new phone and i think set it up to reach the IMEI and i don't know if i want to do that yet.
[02:50:37 PM] Wankhadae: YOu will have the IMEI of the new device on the box?
[02:50:46 PM] Wankhadae: The IMEI will be on the invoice also.
[02:54:07 PM] Terry: My current IMEI is 353338067085974 &amp; the new phone is i think 353338067939758
[02:54:44 PM] Terry: Yes that's right
[02:55:58 PM] Wankhadae: I would like to inform you that the warranty f the ld device will be transferred to the new device.
[02:55:58 PM] Terry: Again i have no complaint what so ever with CC their the best.
[02:57:24 PM] Terry: By the way i have no problem with the phone other that i can't hear calls comming in.
[02:57:55 PM] Wankhadae: Yes Terry send the default device back.
[02:57:58 PM] Wankhadae: Use the new device.
[02:58:19 PM] Wankhadae: If you face the same issue I suggest you to send your device for repair.
[02:58:52 PM] Wankhadae: There will be no repair fee for the device if the device is in warranty and if there is no physical damage.
[03:00:52 PM] Terry: What does that mean??? If i develop the same problem i should send it back to Motorola at my cost to repair since it's past the year guarantee even though the last new phone was just started today?
[03:01:39 PM] Wankhadae: If you have the same issue there will be no repair fee until the device is in warranty.
[03:02:33 PM] Wankhadae: With no physical damage.
[03:02:51 PM] Terry: In invent there is an issue will our conversation be on my record to look back on?
[03:06:12 PM] Wankhadae: There will be no shipping charges also Terry.
[03:06:30 PM] Terry: Just trying to make sure i understand what to do. If i have a problem after my year guarantee can or do i send it back for repair to Motorola and not CC.
[03:08:22 PM] Wankhadae: Yes, You can send your device to our repair center even warranty period expired &nbsp;if you have any issue with the device. But there will be repair fee if the device is out of warranty.
[03:11:04 PM] Terry: So as far as you have been told thee is no ongoing sound problem with these phones? I would just like to get to the bottom of this so if i'm doing something wrong i don't know about i can change that or i'm just very unlucky with three bad phones in a row.
[03:12:04 PM] Wankhadae: We are sorry for the inconvenience has this caused.
[03:12:31 PM] Wankhadae: We rarely come across this kind of issues. And I can understand it must be frustrating.
[03:12:44 PM] Wankhadae: But do not worry! We are here to help you out.
[03:12:43 PM] Terry: OK we'll see what happens. Thanks for you help
[03:12:55 PM] Wankhadae: You're welcome.
[03:13:04 PM] Wankhadae: Is there anything else I may assist you today?

[08:01:37 PM] Aimee: Yes
[08:03:28 PM] Syed: Alright. I would like to inform you that Moto g3 doesn&#39;t support Verizon as it is just a GSM device.

[08:10:11 PM] Syed: Thank you for confirming.

[08:14:15 PM] Syed: I would like to inform you that it doesn&#39;t support CDMA, as the device is unlocked for GSM. However I would suggest you to once cross check with Verizon as they may provide you the subsidy unlock code to use the network.

[01:20:27 PM]ashish: Hi Johanna.<br />
[01:20:54 PM]ashish: I purchased a new Motorola Moto G4 Plus 64 GB smartphone<br />
[01:21:12 PM]ashish: I am in the process activating it on a CDMA network in USA<br />
[01:22:36 PM]ashish: For that I need to locate the ICCID of the phone. It is not included on the box along with the other numbers (such as MEID, MSN, IMEI, serial and models numbers). Where can I find the ICCID?<br />
[01:24:53 PM]Johanna: Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and I am glad that I would be able to assist you.<br />
[01:25:51 PM]Johanna: But  with your concern you would be able to get the UICCID  at your service provider.<br />
[01:26:56 PM]ashish: I do not have a service setup with this device yet. In order to activate the device the service provider needs the ICCID in addition to the MEID. But I cannot find the ICCID anywhere on the box or on the device.<br />
[01:28:23 PM]Johanna: It is inscribed on the back of the SIM Card.<br />
[01:29:25 PM]Johanna: A full ICCID is 19 or 20 characters. ICCID can be thought of as the serial number of the SIM Card.<br />
[01:30:35 PM]ashish: But I don't have any SIM card yet as I have not yet purchased any service for this new phone. In that case why would the service provider require the ICCID if the customer already has a SIM card and service ?<br />
[01:31:05 PM]ashish: for new service?<br />
[01:32:45 PM]Johanna: That's why you have  to get a service provider first.you have to ask your carrier. we cannot provide you that information .I do apologize.<br />
[01:33:45 PM]Johanna: You have to ask them we only provide the device .we are a manufacturer.<br />

[10:09:21 AM]Lemuel: I check to my resources but still you need to contact you carrier because they are the one who can fix it because it's the issue with your service and actually you can ask them for a higher support.<br />
[10:12:18 AM]Anders: Interesting. My wife has the exact same phone (Moto G4), same service plan (which includes LTE coverage) and her phone has no issues connecting to LTE. I worked with my carrier on this issue and they reported that it might be an issue with the phone.<br />

[10:17:54 AM]Anders: My wife gets much stronger signal strength than that.<br />
[10:18:33 AM]Anders: So, after consulting my carrier I wonder if there isn't an issue with the phone.<br />
[10:20:13 AM]Lemuel: Base on my higher support, you still to contact again your carrier because it's the service not the phone.<br />
[10:20:55 AM]Anders: OK. I will work with my carrier.<br />

[10:21:15 AM]Anders: If I call my carrier and they assert that it's a phone and not a service issue, can I return my phone?<br />
[10:21:27 AM]Anders: I purchased it in Nov. 2016 and I believe it is under a 1 year limited warranty<br />
[10:23:41 AM]Lemuel: Yes.<br />

[10:32:57 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: IMEI no. - 358195071043844<br />
[10:33:27 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Had chat with Shirisha and Saikiran a while ago and they gave up<br />
[10:33:56 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: They said it's on carrier part to activate it<br />
[10:34:17 AM]Lemuel: Hello, thank you for contacting us. I'll be more than glad to assist you today.<br />
[10:34:20 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Whats your opinion?<br />
[10:34:27 AM]Lemuel: Where are you located?<br />
[10:34:32 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: India<br />
[10:35:07 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: I am quite sure that it's on your part to get Volte activated<br />
[10:35:41 AM]Lemuel: I'm sorry but we're not supporting India.<br />
[10:35:47 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Moto X Play recently got an OTA update of 19.6 mb after which Volte got activated in those phones<br />
[10:36:05 AM]Lemuel: You need to contact your carrier.<br />
[10:36:17 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Whom should I approach then?<br />
[10:36:43 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Carrier say since phone is purchased from USA they know nothing about the phone<br />
[10:37:02 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: According to them my phone does not support 4g<br />
[10:37:11 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Is this believable?<br />
[10:37:39 AM]Lemuel: Actually since you're using the phone in India you need to contact the carrier and they are the one who will activate the service of your phone in India.<br />
[10:38:05 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: How can they change the settings part on my phone<br />
[10:38:36 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Moto X Play recently got an update. That wasn't sent by carrier<br />
[10:40:03 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: I also have got a Moto G4 and it has got the same problem too<br />
[10:40:15 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Both phones purchased from USA<br />
[10:40:54 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Whereas my uncle purchased Moto X Play from India and that phone received the OTA update and is running smooth<br />

[10:41:38 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: But come out with a solution<br />
[10:42:33 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: First my uncle's phone got updated to Android 6.0.1 and then received that 19 mb update for Volte support<br />
[10:42:55 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Whereas my Moto X Pure edition is still running Android 6.0<br />
[10:43:27 AM]Lemuel: Have you try to contact your carrier?<br />
[10:43:39 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Yes, several times<br />
[10:44:03 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Every time they said it's on Motorola's part to provide such OTA update<br />
[10:44:12 AM]Lemuel: because they are the one whi can actiavte your volte services.<br />
[10:44:29 AM]Lemuel: *activate<br />
[10:44:28 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Then why are they saying this<br />
[10:44:57 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Moreover Moto X Play update was not sent by carrier of course<br />
[10:45:21 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: That update was Manufacturers update<br />
[10:45:33 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: And that is the update I am looking for<br />
[10:46:21 AM]Piyush Chamaria Chamaria: Please don't misguide me if you aren't sure<br />

389,9074703,Moto G (4th Gen.),Adjust Personal and Privacy Settings,"[08:38:02 PM] Hi, my name is Kagita. How may I help you?
[08:38:33 PM] Pamela Carde: Hello, I am back. I was on my mobile doing some troubleshooting on a Motorola G4 issues
[08:38:50 PM] Kagita: Yes, Pamela!
[08:39:05 PM] Pamela Carde: Hi, I am rebooting in safe mode now
[08:39:12 PM] Kagita: Sure!
[08:40:50 PM] Kagita: Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner
[08:40:55 PM] Pamela Carde: phone is currently on safemode
[08:41:09 PM] Kagita: Great! Please check with the issues now.
[08:43:07 PM] Pamela Carde: these issues are sporadic,
[08:43:14 PM] Pamela Carde: at the moment they are not happening.
[08:43:49 PM] Kagita: Okay! Have you installed any third party applications recently ?
[08:43:54 PM] Pamela Carde: let me check if I can remove my password, which is another issue
[08:44:00 PM] Pamela Carde: not third party
[08:44:25 PM] Kagita: Okay!
[08:44:28 PM] Kagita: While in Safe Mode, test if the issue remains. If it does, further troubleshooting is needed. If it doesn&#39;t, this means a third party application is causing it. Begin by uninstalling applications recently installed from the Play Store.

Remove the app that causes the problem from the device
[08:45:16 PM] Pamela Carde: all the apps installed are the same apps I have had in my last phone (Samsung)
[08:45:48 PM] Pamela Carde: any application found in the plays store would be considered 3party applications?
[08:46:25 PM] Kagita: Okay! Motorola comes with pure android without making any changes on the device.
[08:47:10 PM] Kagita: Yes! Any application the you download from play store will be third party application.
[08:47:46 PM] Kagita: Motorola does not add any bloatware like other device manufactures do. Please check the ratings and reviews before you install any application.
[08:48:12 PM] Kagita: Have you tried changing the password?
[08:48:23 PM] Pamela Carde: yes,
[08:48:31 PM] Pamela Carde: I actually want to remove my password
[08:48:37 PM] Pamela Carde: but I don&#39;t seem to find that option
[08:48:51 PM] Pamela Carde: there is no option &quot;none&quot;
[08:48:53 PM] Kagita: Okay! Please go to settings>>Security>>Password.
[08:49:02 PM] Kagita: Do you see Swipe?
[08:49:39 PM] Pamela Carde: no
[08:50:07 PM] Pamela Carde: there is no password option after security
[08:50:13 PM] Pamela Carde: only screen lock
[08:50:28 PM] Kagita: Yes! You need to tap on screen lock.
[08:50:49 PM] Kagita: You will see none option inside &quot;Screen lock&quot;
[08:50:49 PM] Pamela Carde: ok. swipe is there
[08:51:16 PM] Pamela Carde: yes
[08:51:33 PM] Kagita: I suggest you to set swipe instead of none. Selecting none can easily unlock itself inside pocket.
[08:52:15 PM] Kagita: You password has been removed now. It is set to swipe, please lock the device and try to unlock it.
[08:52:36 PM] Pamela Carde: yes, no password required
[08:52:46 PM] Kagita: Great!
[08:53:08 PM] Pamela Carde: so, now the issues are: call choppy in particular areas, menu hides sometimes
[08:53:49 PM] Kagita: Yes, Menu hides when you are viewing something on screen. If you tap on the screen menu will appear again.
[08:54:07 PM] Pamela Carde: it doesn&#39;t though
[08:54:32 PM] Pamela Carde: it normally hides, but when I tap in the lower part it should pop up but in several occasions it doesnt
[08:54:56 PM] Pamela Carde: I have to switch users, then back at my account for it to show up and it would ask for my password,
[08:55:30 PM] Kagita: Please check if it is doing same now.
[08:56:57 PM] Pamela Carde: not doing it at the moment
[08:57:57 PM] Kagita: Okay! It is the issue with third party applications. I suggest you to uninstall the application one by one and check with the issue. Make sure the device apps are up to date, to see this please go to play store and check for the updates.
[08:59:14 PM] Pamela Carde: ok. I will try that
[08:59:35 PM] Pamela Carde: and see how that goes, if additional troubleshooting is required, what do you suggest?
[09:00:48 PM] Kagita: I am sure you don&#39;t need any additional troubleshooting steps. If you still face the issue I suggest you to backup the device data and perform a reset.
[09:00:57 PM] Kagita: Resetting the device will erase entire device data.
[09:02:02 PM] Pamela Carde: ok. I&#39;ll try that as well. Thanks.
[09:02:17 PM] Kagita: You are welcome! Is there anything else I may assist you with today?
[09:03:26 PM] Pamela Carde: not at the moment. thanks.

[09:29:20 AM] Rajesh: I understand your concern and I can certainly assist you with this.
[09:29:51 AM] Rajesh: I understand that you want to silence your device, am I correct?
[09:31:57 AM] phill: Yes. &nbsp;But I know how to silence it by holding the volume. &nbsp;What I want to know is why I do not have the option when I press the power button as it says in all the help files I can find
[09:32:44 AM] Rajesh: Thank you for the confirmation.
[09:32:54 AM] Rajesh: May I know the android version of the device? &nbsp;
[09:33:14 AM] phill: I have no idea. &nbsp;How do I find that
[09:33:36 AM] Rajesh: Go to settings>>about phone>>android version
[09:34:44 AM] phill: Yep. &nbsp;Just found it LOL. &nbsp;Moto X Pure Edition &nbsp;Android version 6.0
[09:35:00 AM] Rajesh: Thank you!
[09:35:49 AM] Rajesh: To silence your phone completely, try using Google&#39;s Do Not Disturb feature.

To set up Do Not Disturb,
open settings > sound and notification > Do Not Disturb.
[09:36:15 AM] Rajesh: Go into Priority Only and select what you want to be considered priority interruptions. Go into Automatic Rules to set up specific times you want the phone to enter a different mode. Choose from priority only interruptions, alarms, or complete silence. Use this feature to quiet your phone at night or when you&#39;re working.
[09:36:49 AM] Rajesh: For more information in regarding this, please explore the following link: https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/prod_answer_detail/a_id/107104/p/30%2C6720%2C9541/kw/silent

[09:38:02 AM] phill: Then please explain why you say there is on YOUR own help page?

[09:40:49 AM] Rajesh: I mean it is applicable for the devices which are running on kitkat.
[09:40:51 AM] phill: So what you are telling me is that I have actually taken a step backwards?
[09:42:23 AM] Rajesh: Please refer the following link for the information about your device https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/prod_answer_detail/a_id/107104/p/30%2C6720%2C9541/kw/silent

[09:44:58 AM] Rajesh: We are sorry for the inconvenience.
[09:45:46 AM] Rajesh: Google changed/modified the options in each update.
[09:46:03 AM] Rajesh: These all changes are made by Google.
[09:46:13 AM] phill: Not your fault Rajesh, but still find it hard to believe that they would remove one of their most useful options !
[09:47:34 AM] Rajesh: I understand your concern. I will consider it as feedback and share it with the respective team.
[09:48:59 AM] phill: OK Thanks for your time. &nbsp;Sorry I will probably have to switch back to my old Samsung as this was a very serious issue for me. &nbsp;It might not seem it to you but we al use phones in different ways. &nbsp;Appreciate your effort

[04:23:11 PM]Neil Goel: imngoel@yahoo.com is my old e-mail, and the Moto G associated with that account is my old phone from years ago. I have since upgraded to a Nexus 6, and the associated e-mail is iamngoel@gmail.com<br />

[02:54:30 PM] Garimella: I would like to inform you that you can move few of the apps which are compatible.
[02:56:04 PM] philip: I can&#39;t move all the apps to the micro sd card
[02:57:18 PM] Garimella: Yes, in marshmallow update we do not have that option to move the apps to SD card. you can move the picture files and videos etc.
[02:57:21 PM] philip: meant that to be a question not a statement ..should be a question mark at the end
[02:57:47 PM] philip: I have moved all my picturs etc already
[02:58:38 PM] Garimella: If you select the SD card as Internal storage then you can store the apps &nbsp;in SD card.
[02:58:57 PM] philip: how do I select the sd card as internal storage
[03:02:06 PM] Garimella: If you select the SD card internal storage, all the data will be erased from SD card.
[03:02:53 PM] philip: is this the case now with all android systems or just the moto g
[03:03:00 PM] Garimella: You need to format the SD card and &nbsp;when you insert &nbsp;in the pone, it pop ups a message saying that select SD card as Internal Storage.
[03:03:35 PM] philip: but then I have the same problem becauase the sd card is only 16 gb
[03:04:20 PM] philip: what you are saying is that I need to go buy a 32 gb card and set up the current internal storage as portable
[03:04:32 PM] Garimella: After Marshmallow update total the memory storage structure has altered.
[03:05:33 PM] Garimella: No need to do that, Set the SD &nbsp;card as Internal storage so that you little amount of memory added to the Internal Storage. You can store the Apps.
[03:05:42 PM] philip: since I will never have 16 gb of pictures ... that makes one of my storage a complete waste
[03:06:09 PM] philip: will it leave the current apps on my current internal storage
[03:07:45 PM] Garimella: After you set the SD card as Internal storage from then the apps will be stored on Internal, and the data you save will be on SD card.

[03:23:04 PM] Garimella: May I know the Issue ?
[03:23:46 PM] philip: i will figure it out .. if I have to, &nbsp;I will do it manually. &nbsp;I can now see the files in my explorer
[03:24:30 PM] Garimella: Okay, If you want the apps on your SD card you need to set the SD card as internal storage.
[03:25:00 PM] philip: thsnks again
[03:25:12 PM] Garimella: Am I helpful to you Philip ?
[03:25:23 PM] Garimella: Hope that I have answered all your queries.

[02:21:18 PM] Sachin: That's the reason you are facing this issue.
[02:21:47 PM] Sachin: I would suggest you to move all your media files to your SD card so that we can make some space.
[02:22:50 PM] ken: How do I correct it? &nbsp;I feel there are quite a few app's that came pre-installed on the phone that I have never used, and there are a quite a few running in the back ground that don't need to be. &nbsp;Most of my space is the Apps (3.08 gb), I only have 227 mb's in pic's &amp; video's.

432,8992702,Moto G (3rd Gen.),Increase/transfer Memory/Storage,"[01:57:40 PM] Hi, my name is Rajesh. How may I help you?
[01:58:19 PM] Nicolet Rubin: We are quite dissatisfied with our Moto G (3rd Gen) and US Cellular is not willing to help us. &nbsp;They say that if we are unhappy with the device we must contact you.
[02:00:07 PM] Rajesh: I am sorry to hear that. I will certainly help you.
[02:00:16 PM] Rajesh:
Could you please provide me the IMEI number of the phone?

You can get that number from the box of the device, by dialing *#06# or by going through the settings> about phone>status> IMEI.
[02:01:06 PM] Nicolet Rubin: 990005752009655 is my phone - my husband is at work so I do not know his
[02:01:47 PM] Rajesh: Thank you for providing the information.
[02:02:06 PM] Rajesh: May I know the reason your dissatisfaction with the device?
[02:04:49 PM] Nicolet Rubin: My husband and I purchased our phones in June of this year and the information they originally told us about the phone was completely incorrect. &nbsp;They had claimed that the phone would be most like our Moto X we previously had....Storage-wise. &nbsp;When we got home and began downloading our apps, we realized that it had half of the storage space of our previous phone (AND we were only able to use 3GB of those 8GB) and we had been told there was no option for an SD Card. &nbsp;We took them back the next day, a different person told us that we could purchase an SD card for additional space. &nbsp;So, my husband purchased cards and we began moving apps and photos over to the card, that worked well until the latest upgrade. &nbsp;Now we are only able to move media files to the SD Card and again, we have run out of space on the phone. &nbsp;US Cellular tells us that it is basically not their problem, even though they gave us incorrect information when we bought them.
[02:04:50 PM] Rajesh: Hi! this is the Motorola System, I noticed you have been away from the chat session for 2 minutes. I’ll stay here until the next minute so that our representative can continue to help you with your concern.

[02:05:18 PM] Rajesh: Please give me a minute while I review your concern.
[02:05:58 PM] Nicolet Rubin: Also, my phone volume will not stay on vibrate, it defaults back to a ring tone after a certain amount of time. &nbsp;And, we are unhappy with how sensitive the screen is. &nbsp;When scrolling down a screen with your finger, often times the phone will open other pages that you did not intend to open because it is so sensitive.
[02:07:26 PM] Rajesh: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this
[02:07:41 PM] Rajesh: May I know the android version of your device?
[02:08:02 PM] Nicolet Rubin: I do not understand the question.
[02:08:11 PM] Rajesh: You can format the SD card as internal storage on your phone if your device is on Marshmallow (Android 6).
[02:08:32 PM] Rajesh: I suggest you to please check the android version of the device under settings>>about phone>>android version
[02:09:14 PM] Rajesh: Once a card has been formatted as internal storage, &nbsp;both your device internal storage and the card will show up as “device storage” under storage settings, and you will be able to &nbsp;move applications which were in internal storage to the card. Moving applications to the card can be done from application settings (settings->apps->select application->change storage location)
[02:09:25 PM] Rajesh: Once a card has been formatted as internal storage, Play Store will install applications on either storage volume automatically, based on a set of rules provided by the application developer (you will be able to move applications from one volume to another). If the application developer has not provided the correct set of rules for automatic installation to the SD card, each time applications update, you will need to move them back to the SD card.
[02:10:06 PM] Nicolet Rubin: 6.0.1
[02:10:19 PM] Rajesh: Awesome.
[02:11:10 PM] Rajesh: You can format your SD card as internal storage. After formatting it as internal storage you can move your apps to SD card (Note: This is dependent on application developer as they must allow for this feature with their application.)
[02:11:37 PM] Rajesh: Please explore the following for more detailed information regarding this: https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/prod_answer_detail/a_id/109134/p/1449,9582
[02:11:55 PM] Nicolet Rubin: when I go through the steps (settings->apps->select application->change storage location) - change storage location does not appear
[02:12:39 PM] Rajesh: To use that feature you need to format your SD card as internal storage.
[02:13:25 PM] Rajesh: If you format your SD card as internal storage then:

1. The SD card can become your device primary storage

2. Downloaded applications, their data and media can be moved to the card

** This is dependent on application developer as they must allow for this feature with their application.

3. The card is not readable by other devices. (another phone, Mac, PC, digital camera)

4. The card is always encrypted, and can not be decrypted on any other device.

5. The card will be formatted when Portable storage is selected.
[02:14:00 PM] Rajesh: To format your SD card as internal storage:

Go to settings->storage->select card-> menu->format as internal
[02:15:33 PM] Nicolet Rubin: wow...thank you so much. &nbsp;I think maybe education needs to be provided to USCellular staff about this. &nbsp;They told me there was nothing that can be done about the minimal storage.
[02:15:58 PM] Rajesh: You&#39;re welcome.
[02:16:24 PM] Nicolet Rubin: so as far as the volume issues, there is an app that is making it do that?
[02:16:33 PM] Rajesh: And would suggest you to please explore the above given link for more information regarding &quot;Marshmallow - SD card - Tips and Tricks&quot;
[02:17:21 PM] Rajesh: Regarding ringing volume issue, I would suggest you to disable &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; option.
[02:17:56 PM] Rajesh: To disable &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; option:

Drag your notification bar down>>and tap on &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; option.
[02:20:53 PM] Nicolet Rubin: and that should allow me to keep it on vibrate?
[02:23:08 PM] Rajesh: I suggest you to set your ringing volumes to zero and enable &quot;Vibrate for calls&quot;
[02:23:35 PM] Rajesh: Go to settings>>Sounds and notifications>>Ring volume, &quot;Vibrate for calls&quot;
[02:25:49 PM] Nicolet Rubin: I already have it set like that, and randomly the volume will turn back on
[02:27:04 PM] Rajesh: At that time the &quot;Do not Disturb&quot; is disabled?
[02:27:38 PM] Nicolet Rubin: I believe so. &nbsp;it was disabled when I looked at the settings
[02:30:51 PM] Rajesh: Alright, If it was disabled then I would recommend you to test your device in Safe Mode in order to check if the issue you are reporting is software-related. This mode will disable 3rd party apps temporarily, so in case the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, uninstalling a specific app or resetting the phone would solve it.
To access Safe Mode, please follow these steps:
1. &nbsp;Press the Power key
2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off
3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears
4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner

To go back to normal use, simply power cycle the device to disable Safe Mode.

[02:34:15 PM] Rajesh: Nicolet, I don&#39;t mean to rush you, but I have not heard from you. Are we still connected on chat?
[02:34:19 PM] Nicolet Rubin: yes
[02:34:37 PM] Nicolet Rubin: I was trying to get it in safe mode, I must have done something wrong because it only restarted my phone
[02:34:59 PM] Rajesh: Ok, Let me help you to put the device in safe mode.
[02:35:23 PM] Rajesh: Press and hold the power key until you see the &quot;Power off&quot; option on the device screen.
[02:35:39 PM] Nicolet Rubin: done
[02:36:06 PM] Rajesh: After that tap and hold on &quot;Power off&quot; option on screen until you get the safe mode pop-up.
[02:38:34 PM] Rajesh: Have you restarted the device in safe mode?
[02:39:00 PM] Nicolet Rubin: no I did it wrong again LOL I am waiting for it to restart. &nbsp;I just read your instructions wrong. sorry
[02:39:36 PM] Nicolet Rubin: so I wont know for a little bit if the vibrate wont stay on. &nbsp;it takes 15-30 minutes sometimes. &nbsp;
[02:39:51 PM] Nicolet Rubin: If the volume still changes on its own, should I just contact USCellular?
[02:41:52 PM] Rajesh: I suggest you to perform clear data for settings.

Go to settings>>apps>>scroll down to &quot;Settings&quot;>>storage>>clear data
[02:42:21 PM] Rajesh: If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to backup your data and perform factory data reset on phone.
[02:42:40 PM] Nicolet Rubin: by clearing data will I lose all of my information from my apps?
[02:42:45 PM] Nicolet Rubin: or just text messages/call log?

[12:15:46 PM] Meruga: If that encryption was not done successfully,we face this type of issues.

[12:16:07 PM] Emily: I have the second, new one in now
[12:16:18 PM] Meruga: So I suggest you to format your SD card first and again set it as a internal memory.

[10:36:50 AM]Jo Ann: Hello?<br />
[10:37:36 AM]Gabe Holmes: I have restarted in safe mode but no change there.  I cleared the cached data.<br />
[10:40:35 AM]Jo Ann: Okay.<br />
[10:43:28 AM]Jo Ann: Since you already tried Clear Cache the data the last troubleshooting steps that we have for you is to apply factory data reset on your device.<br />

[10:46:25 AM]Jo Ann: Where did you purchase the phone Gabe?<br />
[10:47:00 AM]Gabe Holmes: We bought it from the website for our service provider, Republic Wireless.<br />
[10:47:59 AM]Gabe Holmes: We bought it two months ago.<br />
[10:50:00 AM]Gabe Holmes: Out of curiousity, what is your your warranty policy?  My wife also says that the volume on both the handset and speakerphone is so low at times that she can't even hear.  She was wondering if it was the phone.<br />
[10:50:18 AM]Gabe Holmes: So that combined with this is starting to make her concerned.<br />
[10:50:25 AM]Jo Ann: Okay.  If you want you can also check it with Republic Wireless for another option.<br />
[10:52:27 AM]Jo Ann: We can process a repair of your phone if there is no physical damage or liquid damage on the device then it's for free if the device is still on warranty.  But then again before we proceed to that options.  Then we must first apply Factory Data Reset.<br />
[10:54:05 AM]Gabe Holmes: Okay, so factory reset first. Will do.  Thanks!<br />
[10:54:09 AM]Jo Ann: But if want.  You can also check with your service provider for another option.<br />

[04:18:16 PM] Brandon: And when I turned it back on I couldn&#39;t format my SD card to the phone as internal
[04:18:20 PM] Brandon: So then I formatted it again
[04:18:29 PM] Brandon: And now I can&#39;t format the card and wifi doesn&#39;t work -__
[04:18:42 PM] Brandon: Is there anyway I am able to reinstall android?

[04:23:33 PM] Savanapalli: As I understand, you did factory reset on your phone and now you can&#39;t format sd card as internal again, Am I correct?
[04:23:51 PM] Brandon: That&#39;s one problem
[04:23:57 PM] Brandon: And now Wifi doesn&#39;t work
[04:24:17 PM] Brandon: And I haven&#39;t been able to set up the phone to tell you what else isn&#39;t working
[04:24:38 PM] Brandon: Because I don&#39;t get unlimited data so I do not want to download apps on my phones service
[04:24:50 PM] Brandon: With the SD card, 2 things happen
[04:25:09 PM] Brandon: I format it as internal and it stays stuck at 30% finished until it gives me some error
[04:25:22 PM] Brandon: I believe it&#39; some sort of time out error
[04:25:51 PM] Brandon: And if I format it as external that works, but it never actually makes it to 100% it just goes to 20% and finished. However it does work as external
[04:27:28 PM] Savanapalli: Which class SD card are you using for your device?
[04:27:49 PM] Brandon: I think it&#39;s a SSamsung evo 64gb
[04:27:55 PM] Brandon: Let me put it into perspective
[04:28:06 PM] Brandon: This option worked for me BEFORE I system wiped
[04:28:09 PM] Brandon: And now it doesn&#39;t
[04:28:14 PM] Savanapalli: Did you connected your device to PC/Laptop?
[04:29:04 PM] Brandon: Yes at some point I did
[04:29:37 PM] Savanapalli: Is there any physical damage to the slot/sd card?
[04:30:12 PM] Brandon: No! &nbsp;Surprisingly I haven&#39;t dropped this phone on the floor
[04:30:27 PM] Savanapalli: Do you have any other sd card right now?
[04:30:54 PM] Brandon: Not laying around right now, I know it needs to do a format
[04:31:10 PM] Brandon: I suppose I could try another card, perhaps it got damaged in the process of reformatting
[04:31:34 PM] Brandon: I can try that later, or buy a mall card to test. Is there anyway to fix the wifi problem I am having?
[04:31:51 PM] Savanapalli: Could you please elaborate your wifi issue so that I can help you out?
[04:32:05 PM] Brandon: Yeah so when I go to the Wifi in option
[04:32:10 PM] Brandon: I press on
[04:32:16 PM] Brandon: And it switches over
[04:32:22 PM] Brandon: And not but a second later it switched back to off
[04:32:46 PM] Savanapalli: Is this happening after resetting only?
[04:33:22 PM] Brandon: Yeah this hasn&#39;t happened before I tried to reset
[04:34:18 PM] Savanapalli: I will help you with this, Firstly, let me try to resolve sd card problem.
[04:35:03 PM] Savanapalli: Please go to settings>storage &amp; usb>>tap on sd card>> tap on three vertical dots at the above left corner>>settings
[04:35:39 PM] Brandon: It&#39;s still on setup mode, I will setup at external
[04:35:46 PM] Brandon: It&#39;s stuck at the 20%
[04:36:26 PM] Savanapalli: Can you tell the options displayed there in settings?
[04:36:40 PM] Brandon: Well when I go to the card, it says that I need to set it u
[04:36:42 PM] Brandon: up
[04:36:56 PM] Brandon: And I get the two options, either internal or external
[04:37:07 PM] Brandon: So then it prompts me that it will erase everything
[04:37:11 PM] Brandon: I click okay
[04:37:17 PM] Brandon: Then it says Formatting the Samsung SD card
[04:37:22 PM] Brandon: And it&#39;s at 20%
[04:37:30 PM] Brandon: It started at 20% and it stays at 20%
[04:38:11 PM] Savanapalli: Please remove the sd card and re-insert it
[04:38:17 PM] Brandon: This thing come up, and I can&#39;t read it fast enough
[04:38:23 PM] Brandon: Something about Thread bender giving up
[04:38:28 PM] Brandon: Timing out
[04:39:16 PM] Savanapalli: Alright
[04:39:27 PM] Savanapalli: I would recommend you to try with another sd card
[04:39:46 PM] Brandon: I don&#39;t really have one right now
[04:39:54 PM] Brandon: When I bought this phone I came from a Samsung Note 5
[04:40:08 PM] Brandon: I bought this SD card specifically for this phone because it has 16gb internal storage
[04:40:49 PM] Savanapalli: I understand, but to check whether this is an issue with sd card or phone we need to use other sd card.
[04:42:29 PM] Savanapalli: Hi Brandon, Are you there?
[04:42:34 PM] Brandon: If I take it out and put it into my very old note 3
[04:42:43 PM] Brandon: It works perfectly
[04:43:30 PM] Savanapalli: I understand but please once try other sd card with this phone to eliminate the possibilities of sd card causing isssue.
[04:43:54 PM] Brandon: Let me look around really fast, I know I should have at least 1 card laying around
[04:45:34 PM] Savanapalli: Have you found any other sd card?
[04:45:56 PM] Brandon: Not yet
[04:48:02 PM] Brandon: I remembered I was using 2 on my Pro Duo adapter for my Psp, Isuppose I could try one of those
[04:48:09 PM] Brandon: This one i a 16
[04:48:10 PM] Brandon: gb
[04:48:32 PM] Savanapalli: Please try it and let me know once you are done
[04:50:54 PM] Brandon: so it worked
[04:51:01 PM] Brandon: But it said that the samsung card appears to be slow
[04:51:12 PM] Brandon: Which is total BS because it&#39;s one of the better cards on the market
[04:51:32 PM] Savanapalli: It seems the problem with the previous sd card.
[04:51:53 PM] Brandon: Yeah, I suppose so
[04:52:08 PM] Brandon: Well thanks for helping me with my SD card!
[04:52:15 PM] Brandon: Now we need wifi lol
[04:52:17 PM] Savanapalli: You are most welcome.
[04:52:32 PM] Savanapalli: Please do not worry about your phone, there is no issue with the phone.
[04:52:42 PM] Savanapalli: Let me have a look at WiFi issue.
[04:52:52 PM] Savanapalli: Since how long are you facing this issue?
[04:53:24 PM] Brandon: Since last night when I factory reset it twice just to get it to work
[04:54:43 PM] Savanapalli: Was it worked fine before factory reset?
[04:54:49 PM] Brandon: Yeah
[04:55:04 PM] Savanapalli: Let&#39;s follow a few troubleshooting steps which should help us resolve this.
[04:55:18 PM] Brandon: Sure
[04:56:02 PM] Savanapalli: Please go to settings>>apps>>settings>>storage>>clear data
[04:56:41 PM] Brandon: OKay
[04:56:52 PM] Brandon: I did that
[04:56:55 PM] Savanapalli: Did it resolve the issue?
[04:57:02 PM] Brandon: No
[04:57:14 PM] Savanapalli: Alright
[04:58:13 PM] Savanapalli: Go to settings>>apps>>tap on vertical three dots at the above right corner>>Reset app preferences.
[04:58:42 PM] Brandon: OKay I did that
[04:58:51 PM] Brandon: It also did not resolve the problem
[04:59:07 PM] Savanapalli: Press power key >> tap and hold on Power off option on display for 5 to 10 seconds >> select reboot to safe mode.
[04:59:40 PM] Brandon: Okay!
[05:00:28 PM] Brandon: Alright, It started, let me check
[05:00:48 PM] Brandon: No, same thing. Doesn&#39;t work
[05:01:11 PM] Savanapalli: Is safe mode appeared at the bottom of the screen?
[05:01:25 PM] Brandon: Yes
[05:01:57 PM] Savanapalli: Alright
[05:02:44 PM] Savanapalli: I&#39;d recommend you to do factory reset once, We rarely come across these kind of issue, but we resolved the issue with factory reset.
[05:02:57 PM] Brandon: OKay I will do 3rd reset :o
[05:04:13 PM] Savanapalli: I would recommend you to do it once and let me know if the issue resolved.
[05:05:18 PM] Brandon: It loading
[05:05:35 PM] Savanapalli: When using this feature; everything is deleted from the device.
[05:05:46 PM] Savanapalli: We recommend back up all your data before proceeding
[05:05:54 PM] Savanapalli: With the phone powered off, press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power button at the same time until the device turns on.
[05:06:15 PM] Brandon: Most of it was back upped before the first reset
[05:06:33 PM] Brandon: Was I supposed to do that before it booted up?
[05:06:36 PM] Brandon: It has already booted up
[05:06:49 PM] Brandon: It&#39;s just at the M loading screen
[05:07:20 PM] Savanapalli: Please allow a few minutes to complete reboot.
[05:07:43 PM] Brandon: Okay!
[05:08:36 PM] Savanapalli: Did it resolve your issue?
[05:08:40 PM] Brandon: Let me check
[05:08:50 PM] Brandon: I don&#39;t think so
[05:08:57 PM] Brandon: Because when I press the yellow triangle
[05:09:02 PM] Brandon: And it says select a wifi network
[05:09:05 PM] Brandon: Nothing comes up
[05:09:15 PM] Brandon: But I remember when I first used this phone there was wifi networks
[05:09:17 PM] Brandon: Here
[05:09:27 PM] Brandon: So I don&#39;t think so :o
[05:10:47 PM] Savanapalli: Is your phone rebooted?
[05:11:03 PM] Brandon: Yeah, I&#39;m going to turn it off
[05:11:25 PM] Brandon: Okay I booted it up the way you said to
[05:11:29 PM] Brandon: I see and android
[05:11:39 PM] Brandon: And it says AP Fastboot Flash mode in red
[05:11:46 PM] Brandon: And a bunch of other information
[05:12:09 PM] Savanapalli: Did yo try reset before?
[05:12:14 PM] Brandon: Yeah
[05:12:30 PM] Brandon: The Wifi option still did not work for me :(

[03:07:14 PM] Jane: Rebooting the phone hasn&#39;t helped either

[03:08:10 PM] Jane: Yes
[03:08:47 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to once check with other SD card.
[03:09:28 PM] Wankhadae: This will confirm whether the issue is with the SD card or the slot.

[03:11:11 PM] Jane: and gives me the option to set it up in a supported way

[03:15:32 PM] Wankhadae: The second SD card is being recognized in other device?

[03:16:39 PM] Jane: Ok, but how do I back up what is on the SD card if the phone does not recognise it, and the data is encrypted because it is internal storage?
[03:17:37 PM] Wankhadae: I suggest you to insert the SD card in the card reader and connect it to your PC.
[03:18:27 PM] Jane: The SD card was formatted by the phone when I mounted it as internal storage
[03:18:36 PM] Jane: It cannot be read by any other device because it has been formatted for the phone

[03:22:26 PM] Wankhadae: We don&#39;t like to see our customers upset and inconvenienced. We always strive to create a positive customer experience.
[03:22:37 PM] Wankhadae: I&#39;ll pass what you&#39;ve said onto our management team as feedback.
[03:22:46 PM] Wankhadae: So they can release any patch file for the issue.

[06:35:00 PM] ben: i have two issues and want to take care of them one at a time.
[06:35:19 PM] ben: the first: over the past few days, i&#39;ve been getting an interesting interruption in my Moto G3
[06:36:04 PM] ben: anything I&#39;m doing will be interrupted by a blank black screen with the words &quot;The update is successful.&quot; and nothing else, except an &quot;OK&quot; button at the bottom
[06:36:19 PM] Kagita: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this
[06:36:23 PM] ben: my antivirus software hasn&#39;t found any issues and i haven&#39;t done any updates
[06:36:44 PM] Kagita: Yes I will surely assist you with this.
[06:36:45 PM] Kagita: Could you please provide me with the IMEI number of your phone? It can be found on the side of the box, under Settings > Phone info > Status, or by dialing *#06# on the main screen of your handset
[06:37:42 PM] ben: 99000575297856
[06:38:05 PM] Kagita: Thank you for providing the information.
[06:38:18 PM] Kagita: I suggest you to uninstall anti virus on the device.
[06:38:41 PM] Kagita: Motorola devices comes with pure android which will not attract virus.
[06:38:53 PM] Kagita: Lets check the device in safe mode.
[06:39:14 PM] ben: the anti virus came with the phone (from Virgin Mobile)
[06:40:14 PM] ben: how do we check it in safe mode?
[06:40:20 PM] Kagita: Please wait!
[06:40:51 PM] Kagita: Thank you for staying online.
[06:40:57 PM] Kagita: Please follow the below steps.
[06:40:58 PM] Kagita: To Enable Safe Mode

1. Press the Power key until &quot;Power off&quot; comes up on the screen. Then release the button.

2. Touch and hold &quot;Power off&quot; on the screen.

3. Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears

4. Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner
[06:42:10 PM] ben: ok, it is in safe mode
[06:42:51 PM] Kagita: Please check with the issue now.
[06:43:05 PM] Kagita: Do you see anti virus application? Or is it grayed out?
[06:43:53 PM] ben: it is still there. it is the Gadget Guardian application that came with the phone
[06:44:20 PM] Kagita: Okay! Do you still see the interruption?
[06:44:50 PM] ben: no, but that&#39;s because I clicked the OK button. the interruption pops up randomly
[06:45:52 PM] Kagita: Do you see it in safe mode too?
[06:46:05 PM] ben: the interruption hasn&#39;t popped up yet
[06:46:11 PM] ben: it only pops up randomly
[06:46:58 PM] Kagita: Third party applications might be causing the issue.
[06:46:59 PM] Kagita: Safe mode starts the device without any 3rd party applications being started. It is used to troubleshoot issues. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, this indicates a 3rd party application is the culprit.
[06:47:29 PM] ben: hm. how can i identify which 3rd party application is causing this?
[06:47:58 PM] Kagita: Begin by looking for specific application types such as launchers, task killers or anti-virus apps.
[06:48:27 PM] Kagita: While in Safe Mode, test if the issue remains. If it does, further troubleshooting is needed. If it doesn&#39;t, this means a third party application is causing it. Begin by uninstalling applications recently installed from the Play Store.

Remove the app that causes the problem from the device
[06:49:30 PM] ben: ok, i will play around with that.
[06:49:42 PM] ben: second issue: is gorilla glass easily breakable?
[06:51:16 PM] Kagita: I am sorry it is not completely unbreakable it stops from scratches, light falls etc.
[06:51:53 PM] ben: i dropped my phone from only about 2 feet onto my soft shoe and the glass cracked. is that common?
[06:52:56 PM] Kagita: Yes! It will break. 2 feet on hard floor would damage the screen.
[06:53:37 PM] ben: do you know typically how much it cost to replace a cracked screen? the phone works completely fine except for this small crack
[06:54:41 PM] Kagita: Sure please give me a minute to find that out for you.
[06:57:03 PM] Kagita: Thank you for staying online.
[06:57:10 PM] Kagita: This will cost you $60
[06:57:56 PM] ben: do i have to take it to a store? how long does it usually take to get it fixed?
[06:58:03 PM] Kagita: Device is in warranty. Since it is a damage there will be a charge for the repair otherwise the repair will be free.
[06:58:27 PM] Kagita: You need to place a request online. This process will take 4-5 business days.
[06:58:42 PM] ben: ok, thanks. that&#39;s all i need today. thank you
[06:58:51 PM] Kagita: 1. &nbsp; &nbsp;We will email you a prepaid FedEx shipping label. Use the label to send your malfunctioning device to us.
2. &nbsp;We will do a repair assessment on your device. NOTE: If your device will cost more to repair than we originally estimated OR if your device is not repairable, we will call or email you.

[07:58:59 PM]Brett Gelman: Basically, it is having ""ghost touch"" issues where the phone reacts without even touching the screen.<br />
[07:59:40 PM]Brett Gelman: I have tried every suggested fix from the previous moto reps including safe mode and factory reset, etc.  Nothing worked.<br />
[08:00:23 PM]Brett Gelman: I was told that the only option was to mail it to the repair center, which I did in November.  However, when it came back, it exhibited the same exact problem.  Nothing was fixed.<br />
[08:01:00 PM]Dyril: I'm sorry to see that you are experiencing issue with your device. And nothing works for all the steps that was provided. Don't worry, I'll do me best to help you.<br />
[08:01:21 PM]Brett Gelman: Now I was told tonight to mail it back to the repair center for a second time.  It is very frustrating because the phone is a lemon.  It never worked right.  With these ""ghost touch"" issues, the phone is rendered un-usable.<br />
[08:02:02 PM]Dyril: To begin with can you verify me your name, email address and phone number?<br />
[08:02:09 PM]Brett Gelman: Not sure what sending it to the repair facility for a second time will be different from whatever repair they tried the first time they worked on the phone.<br />
[08:02:34 PM]Brett Gelman: Brett Gelman. gelmanb@yahoo.com 239-823-8001<br />
[08:03:22 PM]Dyril: Can you please tell me where are you located?<br />
[08:03:33 PM]Brett Gelman: Fort Myers, Florida<br />
[08:04:20 PM]Dyril: Thank you so much for this information, one moment here while I'm checking this one for you. Okay?<br />
[08:04:29 PM]Brett Gelman: OK<br />
[08:06:48 PM]Dyril: Can I have the IMEI of your phone?<br />
[08:07:18 PM]Brett Gelman: 354124071095277<br />
[08:08:06 PM]Dyril: Thank you. Is this the same phone that you sent in for repair?<br />
[08:08:29 PM]Brett Gelman: Yes.  G4<br />
[08:09:42 PM]Dyril: I see. Have you tried to follow all the troubleshooting steps that was provided?<br />
[08:10:58 PM]Brett Gelman: Yes I did.  They were done while on the phone and online with a moto rep.  None of them worked.  These were tried prior to sending the phone to motorola for repair and the steps were tried after I received the phone back and still experienced problems.<br />
[08:12:02 PM]Dyril: I see. Who is your carrier?<br />
[08:12:10 PM]Brett Gelman: Verizon<br />
[08:15:44 PM]Dyril: I see. For this one, we really need to send your phone for a repair since all the troubleshooting steps have been provided and performed.<br />
[08:16:19 PM]Dyril: Don't worry, we will request to process a replacement this time.<br />
[08:16:33 PM]Brett Gelman: But it has already been sent for repair and it came back to me with the same exact problem.  So I am just trying to figure out what will be different this time.<br />
[08:17:39 PM]Brett Gelman: It's frustrating because it is an inconvenience to be without the phone.  Plus, I spent a lot of money on the phone and it hasn't worked properly.<br />
[08:19:18 PM]Dyril: I understand, and we apologize for the inconvenience that has caused.<br />
[08:20:48 PM]Brett Gelman: It's been this way since September without any proper solution to the problem.<br />
[08:22:03 PM]Dyril: For this one, I'll be providing this Reference Number 170117-015263 so that your concern will be escalated to our Repair Support and Solutions Team.<br />
[08:23:47 PM]Brett Gelman: I just received the e-mail with the fed-ex mailing info from the moto rep I spoke with on the phone.  I guess I have no alternative but to mail the phone for a second time.  It just seems like a waste of time since this was already tried and motorola already tried to repair the phone.<br />

[09:35:10 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Hi Cheryl, how can I assist you day?<br />
[09:35:49 AM]Cheryl: on new years eve a couple of hours after i unplugged my phone from the charger the screen just went blank. i could still hear sounds and my phone ringing but i could not access the screen, it was dark.<br />

[09:36:54 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Let's try some troubleshooting step with your phone, before that may I just ask what is the phone number associated on your phone?<br />
[09:37:03 AM]Cheryl: i went into a verizon dealer that day after work and they checked for any damage and said my phone was in perfect condition no  trauma from dropping it, no water damage, i have always had a protective case on it and i dont over charge it<br />
[09:37:14 AM]Cheryl: 702.755.2963<br />
[09:38:02 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Thank you Cheryl.<br />
[09:38:05 AM]Cheryl: we did some trouble shooting at the store and that was not effective. then we were on hold with tech support for almost 1 1/2 hours with no answer<br />
[09:38:48 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: I'm so sorry for that Cheryl, may I just asked what are the trouble shooting steps that you already did?<br />
[09:40:05 AM]Cheryl: the tech told me i should come back another day. i worked all day yesterday and today is the first chance i have had to reach out to verizon. i have been with out my phone going on the third day. the tech sent out a signal to my phone and looked at a sim card i think or some time of card in the top of the phone. she thinks that the led display is the problem she also took off the screen protector and did not replace it which i found very dissapointing<br />
[09:41:06 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: I may not understand what you are feeling right now but don't worry about that Cheryl. In that case, can you try pressing and holding the power key for 30 seconds.<br />
[09:41:22 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: To check if the phone is still working.<br />
[09:42:23 AM]Cheryl: we did do that as well. the phone rings when some one calls it and if i get lucky i can swipe and pick up the call. i can hear just fine and i can also hear with i have a text message or an alert i just cannot see the screen<br />
[09:43:17 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: I see, did you also tried pressing and holding it while the phone is plugged in wall charger?<br />
[09:43:43 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: *pressing and holding the power key for 30 seconds.<br />
[09:45:17 AM]Cheryl: Yes I did. I really like my phone and would like it repaired or replaced. Up until this point I have had no problems with it. But i am dissappointed with the service i got at my local verizon. they did want to take the time to help because it was new years eve they just told me to come back another day. they still had a few hours before they closed so i found that very unproffesional.<br />
[09:46:18 AM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: I'm sorry Cheryl for what you've experienced. If you would like I can check what are the repair options we can provide for you here in Motorola.<br />
[09:47:35 AM]Cheryl: That would be great. I dont have a landline and have some medical conditions. I fell very uncomfortable not have my phone. Thank you for all your help, i do appreciate it.<br />

You can get that number from the box of the device, by dialing *#06# or by going through the settings> about phone>status> IMEI.
[02:44:29 PM] Rajesh: Hi! this is the Motorola System, I noticed you have been away from the chat session for 2 minutes. I’ll stay here until the next minute so that our representative can continue to help you with your concern.

[02:44:38 PM] Stacey: 355486061343051

[02:45:23 PM] Rajesh: Thank you for providing the information.
[02:45:47 PM] Rajesh: I understand that the device has lines on it&#39;s display, am I correct?
[02:46:19 PM] Stacey: Sometimes. &nbsp;Mostly it&#39;s a odd pink hue to everything.
[02:46:45 PM] Rajesh: How long have you been experiencing this issue?
[02:47:12 PM] Stacey: It started Friday evening.
[02:47:32 PM] Rajesh: Does the device has any physical damage or has it been dropped?
[02:48:09 PM] Stacey: No. &nbsp;I just looked at it after dinner and it was pink.
[02:48:16 PM] Rajesh: Have you downloaded any app or update the system of the device before this start to happen?
[02:48:50 PM] Stacey: No. &nbsp;I was using Google maps to drive somewhere right before it happened.
[02:49:03 PM] Rajesh: Have you tried any troubleshooting previously?
[02:50:14 PM] Stacey: Yes. &nbsp;I looked on forums and tried turning off
[02:50:29 PM] Stacey: Adaptive brightness but did not work.
[02:50:46 PM] Rajesh: Ok, I would suggest following the below troubleshooting steps
[02:50:56 PM] Rajesh: Make sure the display is clean. If the display is scratched or dirty recommend cleaning it with a soft dry cloth. NEVER use any type of liquid on your display.
[02:51:22 PM] Rajesh: If you are using a screen protector or case, try removing to see if the issue is corrected. &nbsp;
[02:52:05 PM] Stacey: It&#39;s something to do with the lighting of the display. &nbsp;It&#39;s not dirty.

4. Touch Factory Data Reset
5. Touch Reset Phone
[02:57:05 PM] Stacey: I don&#39;t want to lose all of information and data with a reset unless it is absolutely necessary. Doing this as a &quot;try and fix&quot; seems like a last resort to me.
[02:57:48 PM] Rajesh: Reset would help us resolving the issue.
[02:58:16 PM] Rajesh: If the issue still persists even after reset then your device may need to be evaluated by our repair center.
[02:58:43 PM] Stacey: So all other options have been extinguished? &nbsp;
[02:59:14 PM] Stacey: If we send to factory repair is all data lost at that point also?
[03:00:27 PM] Stacey: Also, if reset fixes issue I think it is temporary and I will have to do this multiple times resulting in data loss each time. This is not an acceptable resolution &nbsp;
[03:01:29 PM] Rajesh: I understood your concern.
[03:01:42 PM] Rajesh: I request you to kindly check with factory reset.
[03:03:31 PM] Stacey: Ok. It will take some time to backup data. How should I contact you after reset?

[03:16:00 PM] Shirisha: May I know the issue with the device ?
[03:16:54 PM] Karen: Actually it&#39;s a 2nd gen. Sorry for the mistake. My phone will show that I have plenty of charge left but will suddenly shut off. When I plug it back in, it doesn&#39;t show the battery as completely drained but it will show less than indicated before it shut off
[03:17:21 PM] Shirisha: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this.
[03:17:42 PM] Shirisha: Before we proceed further may I know the place of purchase? (country )
[03:17:48 PM] Karen: USA
[03:17:57 PM] Shirisha: Could you please provide me with the IMEI number of your phone? It can be found on the side of the box, under Settings > Phone info > Status, or by dialing *#06# on the main screen of your handset.

[03:20:32 PM] Karen: yes
[03:20:35 PM] Shirisha: Since how long you are facing this issue ?
[03:20:49 PM] Karen: approximately 1 month
[03:21:05 PM] Shirisha: Have you made any changes to the device before this issue started ?
[03:21:35 PM] Karen: No
[03:21:38 PM] Shirisha: Have you tried any trouble shooting steps to fix the issue ?
[03:23:22 PM] Karen: I found somewhere that you should try letting the battery completely drain and leave it dead for a bit (I left it dead overnight) then let it fully charge without turning it on. I tried this and it did not correct the problem. I also read to use only the qualified charger which is the charger I have been using.
[03:25:01 PM] Shirisha: Have you tried with another charger ?
[03:25:17 PM] Karen: I have tried a &nbsp;car charger as well
[03:26:22 PM] Shirisha: I suggest you to perform safe mode and check.
[03:26:41 PM] Shirisha: To perform Safe Mode I suggest you to follow the below steps.

Press and hold the power button until the power options menu is displayed.
You will find an option &quot;power off&quot;
Tap and hold on &quot;power off&quot; for few seconds.
Reboot to safe mode prompt appears.
Tap the OK option and the device should restart and load into Safe Mode.
[03:28:36 PM] Karen: the device is now in safe mode
[03:29:00 PM] Shirisha: Please check with the issue and let me know if the issue still persists.
[03:29:18 PM] Karen: So I should leave it in safe mode until it happens again?
[03:29:48 PM] Karen: This may take a while
[03:30:20 PM] Shirisha: I suggest you to check your device for a couple of hours in safe mode.
[03:31:15 PM] Karen: Ok I will see what happens. Thanks. It may not always happen though so it may take me a few days to determine
[03:31:54 PM] Shirisha: If the issue is resolved in safe mode then the issue is with the 3rd party application. So I suggest you to uninstall the 3rd party application.
[03:32:09 PM] Karen: what is the 3rd party application?
[03:32:46 PM] Shirisha: 3rd party applications are the applications which you have install from the play store.
[03:33:05 PM] Karen: ok
[03:33:33 PM] Shirisha: If the issue still persists in safe then I suggest you to reset your device to fix the issue.
[03:33:51 PM] Karen: how do you reset the device?
[03:34:02 PM] Shirisha: I will guide you with that Karen.
[03:34:33 PM] Shirisha: By performing reset you will loose all your data. So I suggest you to back up your data before performing reset.
[03:34:57 PM] Shirisha: Is that okay if I send you an email with the backup and reset steps ?
[03:35:09 PM] Karen: yes that would be great, thank you
[03:35:29 PM] Shirisha: Could you please confirm me your email ID ?
[03:36:38 PM] Karen: karen.mcgavern@gmail.com

[09:34:02 PM]TERI LITTLE: Wasn't pink when new, been doing it about 4 days<br />
[09:34:11 PM]HH_Arvin: We do apologize for that one that you are seeing pink hue on the screen.<br />
[09:34:42 PM]HH_Arvin: No worries Teri, I will do my best to help you with this one.<br />
[09:35:04 PM]HH_Arvin: Have you tried to troubleshoot you device?<br />
[09:35:37 PM]TERI LITTLE: Yes, tried changing various display settings - no change<br />
[09:35:57 PM]HH_Arvin: Ok, let me pull up my resources for this concern.<br />
[09:36:37 PM]HH_Arvin: Try power cycling the device Teri.<br />
[09:36:58 PM]TERI LITTLE: Done that numerous times<br />
[09:37:39 PM]HH_Arvin: Ensure that you are not using a case that may be interfering with the proximity sensor. Your touchscreen might stay dark if the sensor just above it is covered. Don't use covers or screen protectors (even clear ones) that cover this sensor.<br />
[09:38:05 PM]TERI LITTLE: No difference<br />
[09:38:24 PM]TERI LITTLE: It is a pink stripe down the center<br />
[09:38:56 PM]HH_Arvin: Check the charger, any charger other than an approved Motorola charger may cause interference (while connected) leading to issues with the touch screen.<br />
[09:39:16 PM]TERI LITTLE: Using a Motorola charger<br />
[09:40:09 PM]HH_Arvin: When the internal memory of the phone is full or close to full, you may experience a sluggish user interface, latency when switching menus, or in some cases the display freezing or reboot.<br />
[09:40:32 PM]HH_Arvin: Check the internal memory of the device.<br />
[09:40:36 PM]TERI LITTLE: OK qo<br />
[09:40:48 PM]TERI LITTLE: We both know that has nothing to do with it<br />
[09:41:15 PM]TERI LITTLE: Pink stripesarenotpartof the warning and there is plenty of memory<br />
[09:41:31 PM]HH_Arvin: Ok Teri.<br />
[09:42:10 PM]HH_Arvin: Can you please use Safe mode to check applications and uninstall if necessary.<br />
[09:42:44 PM]TERI LITTLE: What?<br />
[09:43:14 PM]HH_Arvin: To Enable Safe Mode: Press the Power key until ""Power off"" comes up on the screen. Then release the button.<br />
[09:43:30 PM]HH_Arvin: Then, Touch and hold ""Power off"" on the screen.<br />
[09:43:58 PM]HH_Arvin: After that, touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears.<br />
[09:44:12 PM]HH_Arvin: Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner.<br />
[09:44:23 PM]HH_Arvin: While in Safe Mode, test if the issue remains. If it does, further troubleshooting is needed. If it doesn't, this means a third party application is causing it. Begin by uninstalling applications recently installed from the Play Store.<br />

[04:21:54 PM] Rajesh: Thank you for providing the information.
[04:22:21 PM] Rajesh: I understand that the device gets turned off itself, am I correct?
[04:23:11 PM] Earl: Yes, that is correct, sometimes it urns itself back on sometimes it doesnt
[04:23:25 PM] Rajesh: How long have you been experiencing this issue?
[04:24:12 PM] Earl: It started about a month ago once in a while, now it does this several times a day
[04:24:22 PM] Rajesh: Does the device has any physical damage or has it been dropped?
[04:24:31 PM] Earl: No
[04:24:55 PM] Rajesh: Have you downloaded any app or update the system of the device before this start to happen?

[04:25:04 PM] Earl: No
[04:26:27 PM] Rajesh: Have you tried any troubleshooting previously?
[04:26:39 PM] Earl: No I have not
[04:26:57 PM] Rajesh: How often it is happening for day?
[04:27:03 PM] Rajesh: * for a day?
[04:27:16 PM] Earl: 5 or 6 times at least
[04:27:38 PM] Rajesh: Ok, I would suggest following the below troubleshooting steps
[04:27:54 PM] Rajesh: I would recommend you to test your device in Safe Mode in order to check if the issue you are reporting is software-related. This mode will disable 3rd party apps temporarily, so in case the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, uninstalling a specific app or resetting the phone would solve it.
To access Safe Mode, please follow these steps:
1. &nbsp;Press the Power key
2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off
3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears
4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner

To go back to normal use, simply power cycle the device to disable Safe Mode.

[04:31:18 PM] Earl: When I hold the power key it goes to droid screen and then comes right back on
[04:31:51 PM] Rajesh: Ok, I will help you to reboot the device in safe mode.
[04:31:51 PM] Earl: Now I powered it off finally
[04:32:23 PM] Earl: Do I turn it back on now
[04:32:27 PM] Rajesh: Press and hold the power key and once you get the power off options touch and hold on it.
[04:32:37 PM] Rajesh: You will get a pop-up for safe mode.
[04:34:49 PM] Rajesh: Did you get the option for safe mode?
[04:35:13 PM] Earl: No Tustin keeps turning off and on
[04:36:15 PM] Earl: I have powered it off again, now just hold button until it comes back?
[04:37:47 PM] Earl: Now have safe mode
[04:38:05 PM] Rajesh: Did you get the option for safe mode?
[04:38:15 PM] Earl: Yes
[04:38:38 PM] Earl: It is back on in safe mode
[04:40:03 PM] Earl: What do I do now?
[04:40:12 PM] Rajesh: Ok, Test the device in &nbsp;safe mode for one day.
[04:40:42 PM] Rajesh: If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to backup your data and perform factory data reset.
[04:41:00 PM] Earl: Okay so if it doesn&#39;t turn off it is because of an app?
[04:41:11 PM] Rajesh: Yes.
[04:41:33 PM] Rajesh: If the device works perfectly in safe mode, suggest you to uninstall applications one by one check the device performance.
[04:41:48 PM] Earl: But if it still does, then backup data and do a factory reset?
[04:42:06 PM] Earl: Okay thank you
[04:42:28 PM] Rajesh: Yes. Factory Data Reset is a tool used to remove everything that was imported, added or installed on the device. Keep in mind, when using this feature everything is deleted. So, I would suggest you to backup your data before proceeding with factory reset.
[04:44:24 PM] Earl: Thank you for your help
[04:44:31 PM] Rajesh: My pleasure.

[05:35:48 PM] Miguel: Ghost screen.
[05:35:55 PM] Mohammed: I am sorry to hear that. Let me see how we can best resolve this for you.
[05:36:00 PM] Mohammed: Could you please provide me with the IMEI number of your phone? It can be found on the side of the box, under Settings > Phone info > Status, or by dialing *#06# on the main screen of your handset.
[05:37:26 PM] Miguel: 354124070911730
[05:37:38 PM] Mohammed: Thank you Miguel.
[05:37:51 PM] Mohammed: May I know the country where you purchased the phone?
[05:37:50 PM] Miguel: You welcome
[05:37:58 PM] Miguel: Us
[05:38:13 PM] Miguel: Amazon.com
[05:38:21 PM] Mohammed: Thank you for providing that information.
[05:38:24 PM] Mohammed: Could you please be more specific about the issue?
[05:39:54 PM] Miguel: The screen keep tapping apps or I can&#39;t use my screen lock because it constantly pressing the 9 button. Opens my apps with me touching the screen
[05:40:43 PM] Mohammed: As I understand, there are random touches on the screen with you even touching the device. Am I correct?
[05:40:43 PM] Miguel: Without me touching the screen. Very frustrating
[05:41:09 PM] Mohammed: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.
[05:41:14 PM] Mohammed: To help me better understand the issue, I need to ask some questions. Is that OK with you?
[05:41:25 PM] Miguel: Ok
[05:41:27 PM] Mohammed: How long have you been experiencing this issue?
[05:41:59 PM] Miguel: About a week ago
[05:42:03 PM] Mohammed: Is there any physical or liquid damage happen to the device?
[05:42:26 PM] Miguel: No I have a case and screen protector on it
[05:42:59 PM] Mohammed: I would suggest you to please remove the screen protector and observe if the problem still persist.
[05:43:32 PM] Miguel: I did already still have the issue
[05:44:38 PM] Mohammed: Were there any changes made to the device recently?
[05:44:53 PM] Miguel: No
[05:45:18 PM] Mohammed: Does this happen when the device is placed on charging?
[05:45:30 PM] Miguel: No
[05:45:33 PM] Mohammed: Have you tried any troubleshooting previously?
[05:46:03 PM] Miguel: How can I trouble shoot the problem
[05:46:37 PM] Mohammed: Okay Miguel. I would suggest you to enable safe mode and check if the problem still persist.
[05:46:51 PM] Mohammed: Safe mode starts the device without any 3rd party applications being started. It is used to troubleshoot issues. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, this indicates a 3rd party application is the culprit.
[05:46:59 PM] Mohammed: To Enable Safe Mode

1. Press the Power key until &quot;Power off&quot; comes up on the screen. Then release the button.

2. Touch and hold &quot;Power off&quot; on the screen.

3. Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears

4. Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner
[05:47:15 PM] Mohammed: While in Safe Mode, test if the issue remains. If it does, further troubleshooting is needed. If it doesn&#39;t, this means a third party application is causing it. Begin by uninstalling applications recently installed from the Play Store.
[05:49:16 PM] Mohammed: Have you enabled safe mode?
[05:50:27 PM] &#39;Miguel&#39; is currently &#39;Absent&#39;. Approximately 120 seconds until disconnect.

[01:47:58 PM] Kathryn Battle: I have it fully charged, but after about 2 hours, it just dies
[01:48:05 PM] Khaja: We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.
[01:48:09 PM] Kathryn Battle: And when I looked into getting a repair, it said it would cost me $125!!!
[01:48:17 PM] Khaja: I will certainly help you to fix with this issue.
[01:48:22 PM] Khaja: Could you please confirm the handset that you are using?
[01:48:29 PM] Kathryn Battle: Moto X 2nd gen
[01:48:56 PM] Khaja: In order to proceed further, May I know your device IMEI number and Email address?
[01:49:07 PM] Kathryn Battle: I&#39;ve even bought 4 different types of portable chargers to try to see if that would help, but even when it is connected to those, it dies
[01:49:13 PM] Kathryn Battle: Where do I find the imei?
[01:49:17 PM] Kathryn Battle: ktbattle@gmail.com
[01:49:31 PM] Khaja: I would suggest you to go to settings>>about phone>>status>>IMEI?
[01:50:20 PM] Kathryn Battle: 990004981165503
[01:50:58 PM] Khaja: Thank you for providing the information.\
[01:51:00 PM] Khaja: I
[01:51:39 PM] Khaja: I* Understand is that your device is getting off randomly though you charged it completely,Am I correct?
[01:51:53 PM] Kathryn Battle: Correct
[01:52:08 PM] Khaja: Since when are you facing this issue?
[01:52:40 PM] Kathryn Battle: For at least 2 months
[01:52:51 PM] Khaja: May I know your source of purchase of your phone?
[01:53:00 PM] Kathryn Battle: i bought it directly from you last year
[01:53:27 PM] Khaja: May I know any physical or liquid damage happened to the device ?
[01:53:42 PM] Kathryn Battle: Not prior to this issue
[01:53:54 PM] Khaja: Okay, Did you perform any troubleshooting steps regarding this issue?
[01:53:57 PM] Kathryn Battle: The screen has cracked since the issue began, but I&#39;m not asking to have that changed out
[01:54:07 PM] Kathryn Battle: I just want the software/battery issue fixed
[01:54:27 PM] Kathryn Battle: I did try to turn off apps and I try to keep it plugged in whenever not in use
[01:55:04 PM] Kathryn Battle: I don&#39;t want to send it in and pay to fix the screen. I just want the phone to work like a phone. I don&#39;t care if there is cosmetic damage. So, I don&#39;t think I should have to pay to have a working phone that I already paid for.
[01:55:09 PM] Khaja: Just to confirm, how exactly is your phone is shutting down? does its battery drains completely with in 2 hours after charging it fully and then its turning off?
[01:55:21 PM] Kathryn Battle: It drops to 15% and then just shuts off
[01:55:25 PM] Kathryn Battle: at 15%
[01:55:48 PM] Kathryn Battle: And then it goes to 0% once it is plugged in and shows the battery with the yellow triangle in th emiddle
[01:56:14 PM] Khaja: I&#39;m sorry to hear that! I would suggest you to enable safe mode and then check whether the battery is still draining fastly or not?
[01:56:30 PM] Khaja: To Enable Safe Mode

1. &nbsp;Press the Power key

2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off

3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears

4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner
[01:56:29 PM] Kathryn Battle: How do I enable safe mode?
[01:57:02 PM] Khaja: As you enable safe mode all the third party apps will be disabled in safe mode so you will not be able to see any apps then in safe mode you will be able to use wifi or make call/receive calls so we suggest you to check in safe mode for 5 to 6 hours and then if your device is okay in safe mode then we suggest you to come to normal mode by restarting your device after that if your problem still persisting in normal mode then we suggest you to uninstall one by one apps and then check the status of your device..
[01:57:07 PM] Kathryn Battle: Ok. Didn&#39;t see the Reboot to Safe mode option
[01:57:39 PM] Khaja: In safe mode all the third party apps will be temporarily disabled.
[01:57:43 PM] Khaja: I&#39;ll help you out.
[01:57:54 PM] Kathryn Battle: And I need a lot of the 3rd party apps
[01:57:58 PM] Kathryn Battle: So that&#39;s not really helpful
[01:58:03 PM] Kathryn Battle: I don&#39;t play games
[01:58:19 PM] Kathryn Battle: I have all business related apps....like Chase banking, Good for email, Gmail, etc
[01:58:27 PM] Kathryn Battle: These are not just for fun
[01:58:48 PM] Khaja: I would suggest you to press and release the power button then you&#39;ll be able to see POWER OFF option so tap and hold on it until you see OK to reboot in safe mode option.
[01:58:52 PM] Khaja: Then just tap on OK
[01:59:06 PM] Khaja: Then your device will restart and safe mode appears
[02:00:19 PM] Khaja: I&#39;m sorry but once when you uninstall the apps then you may also re-install it back but while installing it back make sure that you have gone through its reviews and ratings..
[02:00:26 PM] Khaja: I hope you will understand it.
[02:01:17 PM] Khaja: And in case if your issue still perssists then I would suggest you to perform an external factory reset to your device but make sure that you have back up all your data,
[02:02:24 PM] Khaja: So shall I also provide you steps regarding back up data and factory reset ?

[01:23:30 PM]HH_John Michael: Thanks Sarah. How can I help you regarding about you Moto G?<br />
[01:26:18 PM]Sarah Baker: Prior to having this phone, I had a Moto X, first generation.  I use my phone for playing music quite a bit and load music onto it from my laptop.  My Moto G will not play any song that has been ripped from a CD, which I find very frustrating.  I've had the phone since April and I think it played them for the first month or so, but now does not.  My phone also ""freezes"" regularly.  Like glitching.  Sometimes I can simply press the lock button and then unlock it and it will work again, other times  I have to restart it. All of my updates are current, so I'm not sure what would be causing that.<br />
[01:28:23 PM]Sarah Baker: Obviously, these aren't major issues, (well, the glitching might be) but if you could help me fix them, I'd really appreciate.  I don't understand why it's being so contrary when it's less than a year old<br />

[01:34:53 PM]Sarah Baker: And since I was already pestering you about the music issue, I thought I would go ahead and ask<br />
[01:35:52 PM]HH_John Michael: Ensure that you are not using a case that may be interfering with the display sensor. Your touch screen might stay dark if the sensor just above it is covered?<br />
[01:35:52 PM]Sarah Baker: It especially has an issue when making or completing a phone call.  Or if I haven't used for a while and I go to unlock the screen<br />
[01:36:43 PM]Sarah Baker: The case just barely wraps around. It's a rubber BodyGlove one<br />
[01:37:22 PM]HH_John Michael: When the internal memory of the phone is full or close to full, you may experience a sluggish user interface, latency when switching menus, or in some cases the display flickering, freezing or rebooting.<br />Check to see how much internal memory is available on the device: Settings > Storage.<br />

[10:40:24 AM] Shirisha: Yes Dhaval.

[10:17:02 AM] Asmita: Hi Greg, how are you doing?
[10:17:47 AM] Greg Dils: Hi Asmita, I&#39;m great how are you? I have a Moto X Pure. I have been using an SD card for several months as internal adoptable store, and it worked just fine. Lately, it has not been working reliably. After I reset the phone, the SD card will be recognized for a few hours or a few minutes, then the phone will say &quot;Ejecting...&quot; and the SD card is no longer recognized.
[10:19:32 AM] Asmita: I am sorry to hear about that. Let me see how best we can &nbsp;resolve this.
[10:19:49 AM] Asmita: May I know the &nbsp;place of purchase (country)?
[10:19:55 AM] Greg Dils: United States
[10:20:37 AM] Asmita: As I understand SD card recognises only for a period of time. Am I right?
[10:20:58 AM] Greg Dils: Yes that is correct
[10:21:28 AM] Asmita: Check whether the sd card is damaged
[10:21:51 AM] Greg Dils: I have removed it and reinserted it several times. It visually appears ok.
[10:22:02 AM] Asmita: Go to Settings>>Storage>> Check whether SD card Mount and Unmount is visible.
[10:22:43 AM] Greg Dils: When the phone recognizes the SD card, the &quot;Unmount&quot; option is visible. As soon as the phone decides to eject the SD card on its own, the settings page says the SD card is missing
[10:22:54 AM] Asmita: Have you tried this SD card in another device?
[10:23:26 AM] Greg Dils: I am using the card as Android adoptable storage, so it is formatted and encrypted to only work in my device.
[10:23:59 AM] Asmita: Yes, sorry for that.
[10:25:45 AM] Asmita: Could you please stay on line while I review information. Is that okay?
[10:25:58 AM] Greg Dils: Okay thank you
[10:27:12 AM] Asmita: Thank you for being online. I appreciate your time and patience.
[10:27:46 AM] Asmita: I suggest you to check with different SD card.
[10:28:48 AM] Greg Dils: Are there certain brands and sizes that work better than others? I don&#39;t want to keep buying new cards. I have a SanDisk 128GB. I notice it is just slightly small in the slot
[10:30:24 AM] Greg Dils: Is there any program to exchange my 16GB phone for a version with 64GB internal storage? Then I would not need to use the adoptable storage.
[10:30:59 AM] Asmita: Try with Class 4, Class 6, Class 8, Class 10 sd cards
[10:31:31 AM] Greg Dils: I have class 10. Are there certain manufacturers (Samsung, SanDisk, etc.) that are better than others?
[10:33:47 AM] Asmita: We recommend use of a &nbsp;high speed card , such as a UHS-1 type. &nbsp; Class 4 and Class 2 micro SD cards are not recommended foradopted internal storage usage. The performance of these cards is typically 10x slower than internal storage performance.

606,8955254,MOTO E,Insert/Remove SIM/SD Card,"[08:44:41 PM] Hi, my name is Syed. How may I help you?
[08:45:57 PM] Marc: Hi. &nbsp;My battery power went down to 7% and after charging I have no cell service, my phone number and other information is not displayed.
[08:46:55 PM] Marc: I have a Moto E and I can provide you with MEID &nbsp;serial # etc.
[08:47:25 PM] Marc: Are you there Syed?
[08:47:46 PM] Syed: Yes.
[08:48:06 PM] Syed: Sure. In order to proceed further, may I know your device IMEI number, email address and country of purchase of the device?
[08:50:14 PM] Marc: MEID DEC 268435464101449168 &nbsp;MEID HEX A0000051161CD0. &nbsp;email address sparkyrx@hotmail.com USA.
[08:51:15 PM] Syed: Thank you for providing the information.
[08:51:50 PM] Syed: As I understand is that your device has no cell service. Am I right?
[08:53:01 PM] Marc: yes, no service. &nbsp;I thought that it was jst that I had no time on the phone, but now with the minutes increased, still no service.
[08:53:55 PM] Syed: Okay. I would like to suggest you to once cross check with the carrier (network provider) for further assistance.
[08:55:40 PM] Marc: OK. &nbsp;Anything else on the phone settings and status that would help you troubleshoot before I talk with my carrier?
[08:56:40 PM] Marc: Also, are you able to determine if the SIM card has been compromised?
[08:59:31 PM] Syed: I am sorry, we cannot determine but however I suggest you to perform a few troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue.
[08:59:54 PM] Marc: And those steps are?
[09:00:44 PM] Syed: Sure. I suggest you to perform a force reboot on your device. I&#39;ll provide you the steps below.
[09:00:50 PM] Marc: Oh, the rest of the Moto E is fine. &nbsp;I have internet access, can receive email, apps are working.
[09:01:05 PM] Marc: OK
[09:02:00 PM] Syed: you can perform a force reboot on the device by following the steps below.


Press and hold the Power button for 10 - 20 seconds, the device will restart and go through the boot-up sequence.
[09:02:45 PM] Syed: Do let me know once you are done with the above.
[09:03:53 PM] Marc: So it went through the sequence (all the pictures of different globes, right?)
[09:04:04 PM] Syed: Yes.
[09:04:09 PM] Marc: Done
[09:05:19 PM] Marc: Should airplane mode be on or off? (sorry I forgot to ask that before)
[09:05:34 PM] Syed: Off.
[09:06:53 PM] Marc: It is off now. &nbsp;Do I need to repeat the forced reboot?
[09:07:37 PM] Syed: No. Now please check wether the issue has resolved or not?
[09:08:51 PM] Marc: The status does not show the telephone number, network, etc.
[09:09:15 PM] Marc: Anything else?
[09:10:01 PM] Syed: Oh I see. Okay I suggest you to please perform a safe mode on the device. I&#39;ll provide you the steps below.
[09:10:15 PM] Syed: To Enable Safe Mode

1. &nbsp;Press the Power key

2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off

3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears

4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner

In safe mode the 3 rd party applications does not function.And once you power off and on the device would get back to normal mode.
[09:11:46 PM] Syed: Do let me know once you are done with the above?
[09:12:54 PM] Marc: So when I am powered back up to normal mode should the phone work (or hopefully it will) at that time?
[09:14:52 PM] Syed: Just check and let me know whether your issue has resolved in the safe mode or not?
[09:15:39 PM] Marc: I am back up and everything still looks the same. &nbsp;No service, phone number listed, no mobile network state...
[09:17:39 PM] Syed: Oh I see. In that case I would suggest you to perform an external factory reset on the device which may resolve the issue. However after attempting the reset all the data on the device will be deleted. So shall I provide you the troubleshooting steps?
[09:20:39 PM] Marc: Yes. &nbsp;Is it possible to send it as an email also? &nbsp;If all data is deleted is it recoverable?
[09:21:46 PM] Syed: I am sorry unfortunately it will not be recoverable unless you have synced it with your google account earlier.
[09:23:21 PM] Marc: So how do I synch it with my google account?
[09:25:52 PM] Syed: Just to confirm may I know are you able to access internet using Wifi?
[09:26:53 PM] Marc: Yes that works just fine.
[09:28:08 PM] Syed: Okay. Please explore the below links to sync your data with your gmail account:--

[09:29:53 PM] Syed: Would you also like me to send the reset steps to your email address?
[09:31:36 PM] Marc: I am on my laptop, so I need to do them from my phone. &nbsp;Yes, send them. &nbsp;So I should be able to sync with those links from my email
[09:32:03 PM] Syed: Yes you will be able to sync them from email.
[09:32:15 PM] Syed: Sure. Is there anything else I may assist you today?
[09:32:48 PM] Marc: Just a minute....
[09:32:58 PM] Syed: Sure.
[09:34:14 PM] Marc: Yes, send the steps to me about the factory reset to my email as well. &nbsp;Thanks.

[09:00:59 AM] Scott: Hello-- I recently bought a Motorola G4 Plus (64GB) from Amazon
[09:01:12 AM] Scott: Activated it on Sprint network (CDMA) after getting a Sprint SIM
[09:01:39 AM] Scott: It worked great for a few days, but then I updated to the latest Motorola Software update and now my incoming SMS messages are delayed 8-12 hours
[09:02:19 AM] Scott: Outgoing SMS messages work fine, and MMS messages work, though they are still delayed
[09:03:12 AM] Scott: Incoming text messages will arrive in bursts of several messages at once.
[09:04:20 AM] Scott: I also reset the data for the messaging app, so I got a ton of notifications for old text messages, but there are no new text messages. I also erased &#39;data&#39; for SprintDM and went back and updated prl/ updated profile.
[09:04:42 AM] Scott: are you there?
[09:04:48 AM] Sunku: Hello Scott. &nbsp;
[09:04:57 AM] Sunku: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this
[09:05:52 AM] Scott: I think there was a problem with power consumption in an earlier version and some Software engineer probably moved/deactivated the SMS polling code into some other task/schedule
[09:06:57 AM] Scott: Can you confirm this issue? Is motorola actively working on it? &nbsp;I&#39;m tempted to just return this to Amazon for a replacement.
[09:07:08 AM] Sunku: As I understand that you are facing issue in receiving &nbsp;text messages which are not receiving on time they are delayed. Am I right?
[09:07:15 AM] Scott: correct
[09:07:59 AM] Sunku: Okay, We rarely come across this kind of issues Scott.
[09:08:36 AM] Scott: I think it&#39;s only &#39;checking&#39; messages on other network actions like placing a call, switching towers, etc. &nbsp;Do you have a list of changes in the last software update for the G4 plus?
[09:10:29 AM] Sunku: May I know what update you received?
[09:10:44 AM] Scott: it was an android update from motorola
[09:11:07 AM] Sunku: Is it Android 6.0 update?
[09:11:17 AM] Scott: whatever the latest update was
[09:11:28 AM] Scott: ~500MB
[09:12:40 AM] Sunku: Here is the link of Android 6 update changes to the device.

[09:13:01 AM] Scott: It&#39;s a G4 Plus

[09:15:02 AM] Scott: ok-- I&#39;m more interested in a bug list than a feature list.
[09:15:36 AM] Scott: or anything specific to CDMA usage (Sprint/Verizon)
[09:16:12 AM] Sunku: Have you contact Sprint regarding this issue?
[09:16:37 AM] Scott: they won&#39;t provide support since it&#39;s not a sprint phone
[09:18:06 AM] Sunku: I would suggest you to re-insert the Sim and check with the issue.
[09:20:12 AM] Scott: it has voice and data, and I&#39;ve blown away the SprintDM settings (which is the PRL/Profile); I suppose I can do it again. If Motorola can&#39;t confirm the issue, then I&#39;ll just return it.
[09:21:18 AM] Sunku: In order to isolate the issue, I would suggest you to follow few troubleshooting steps. &nbsp;
[09:21:33 AM] Sunku: Please re-insert the Sim card and check for the issue.
[09:22:27 AM] Scott: any other suggestons? what will clearing data on the &#39;settings&#39; app do?
[09:22:53 AM] Sunku: it will just reset your device settings to factory default.
[09:23:10 AM] Scott: when I cleared data on the &#39;SprintDM&#39; app, it went through the &quot;setting up your service&quot; notification as if I inserted a sim
[09:23:25 AM] Sunku: And Also check the device in safe mode.

1. &nbsp;Press the Power key
2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off
3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears
4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner
[09:25:07 AM] Sunku: if the issue still persist in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform factory data reset to the device this will help us in resolving the issue.

To reset your device:
1. Touch Menu
2. Touch Settings
3. Touch Backup &amp; reset
4. Touch Factory Data Reset
5. Touch Reset Phone
[09:25:24 AM] Sunku: Please back up the data before you perform reset.this will delete everything that was installed or imported &nbsp;in the device.
[09:26:16 AM] Sunku: Unfortunately if the issue still persist after reset, then It sounds like your phone may need to be evaluated by our repair center.
[09:26:27 AM] Scott: OK-- thank you.
[09:27:11 AM] Sunku: You&#39;re welcome.
[09:27:17 AM] Sunku: Is there anything else I may assist you with today?
[09:28:19 AM] Scott: no, that&#39;s it-- I&#39;d suggest forwarding it up the chain in case the update was responsible for the loss of SMS.

[02:13:55 PM]Cole: thats not what I said.<br />
[02:14:07 PM]Cole: it will re-enable all of the apps I have disabled.<br />
[02:14:28 PM]HH_Arvin: Yes Cole.<br />
[02:14:55 PM]HH_Arvin: Is your messaging application from Google Playstore?<br />
[02:15:58 PM]Cole: i was using Facebook Messenger as my default<br />
[02:16:23 PM]Cole: I just switched it back to Androids native texting app called ""Messaging""<br />

[02:24:04 PM]HH_Arvin: If that is the case, please contact your Service Provider for this concern.<br />
[02:24:46 PM]Cole: Alright. Will Do. You dont think a factory reset would solve the issue<br />
[02:24:56 PM]Cole: I tried taking my SIM card out and everything<br />
[02:25:16 PM]HH_Arvin: It can, but it will erase everything on your device Cole.<br />
[02:25:39 PM]Cole: I am very aware.<br />
[02:25:52 PM]HH_Arvin: And if you do so, you should have remembered your Google Account that was originally used on the device.<br />
[02:26:10 PM]Cole: Most of my information is in the cloud, the rest I can extract manually before I do the reset<br />
[02:26:17 PM]Cole: I am very tech literate my friend.<br />

[01:33:00 PM]Cody: The watch is very warm whenever it is on, despite having the brightness on the lowest setting, and various power consuming setting turned off<br />

[03:43:13 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Hi Evan, how can I assist you today?<br />
[03:43:49 PM]Evan Bloom: I've chatted with 2 agents before trying to unsuccessfully troubleshoot my Moto Droid Turbo 2, because even with a functioning turbocharger it will only indicate 'Charging slowly.' My own research turned up a 50 page thread on support forums, so I believe it is a known issue.<br />
[03:44:27 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: It's sad to know that you are experiencing some difficulties regarding your phone's battery and power. You don't have to worry, I will be glad to assist you and arrive at the best resolution today.<br />
[03:45:24 PM]Evan Bloom: Okay, great thank you<br />
[03:45:45 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: To begin with, can you please verify your first and last name, email address and phone number?<br />
[03:46:22 PM]Evan Bloom: Absolutely. Evan Bloom/evandbloom@gmail.com/6317070646<br />
[03:46:58 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Thank you Evan, may I ask if you already tried using other wall charger?<br />
[03:47:22 PM]Evan Bloom: Yes I have<br />
[03:47:50 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Does it have the same result with your turbo charger?<br />
[03:48:53 PM]Evan Bloom: All chargers 'charge slowly' on my phone, including a wireless charging pad. All chargers have been tested on my friends phone and are fully funcitonal chargers<br />
[03:49:34 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: Alright, in that case. Let's try some troubleshooting steps on your phone.<br />
[03:49:42 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: May I have the IMEI number of the phone? Please go to Settings > About phone > Status > IMEI/MEID information. Or if you still have the box of the phone, kindly locate for the IMEI/MEID that normally starts with 99000, 35 or A000.<br />
[03:51:15 PM]Evan Bloom: We can try that, but it will be a waste both of our time. The last step we did was a complete reset and wipe of my phone, which did not help. Please know I've already gone through all of them twice with two different Motorola chat agents on Dec 30th. IMEI is 9900 0543 2753 565<br />
[03:51:58 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: It would be best to charge your phone, while it's in a Airplane Mode. I'm also doing that on my phone, to faster charging.<br />
[03:52:57 PM]Evan Bloom: Thank you, but even with the phone powered off it took 6 hours on the turbo charger to go from 30% to 100%. Something is wrong with the device<br />
[03:53:04 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: I see, thank you for the infomation Evan. Since you already did a reset on the phone, the only option left we can do for you, is to send your phone to us for repair.<br />
[03:53:23 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: *information<br />
[03:53:51 PM]Evan Bloom: Is there any solution that does not leave me without a phone? It will be hard for me to go phoneless waiting on repair<br />
[03:54:20 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: No worries, let me go ahead and check what are the options available on your device.<br />
[03:54:26 PM]Evan Bloom: Okay, thank you<br />
[03:56:11 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: I already validated the IMEI number of your phone, and I found out that the model of your phone is a Droid Turbo 2, right? And upon checking it here, your phone is already out of warranty.<br />
[03:56:45 PM]Evan Bloom: Yes, Droid Turbo 2. How long was the warranty? I've had the phone for less than one year.<br />
[03:57:20 PM]HH_Anna Nicole Sindac: We have a one year warranty for every Motorola phones.<br />

[09:26:54 PM] Syed: In order to proceed further, may I know your device IMEI number, email address and country of purchase of the device?
[09:27:30 PM] Jenna: I have no idea what the IMEI number is. I cant turn the phone on. My email address is coluccijenna7@gmail.com and it was purchased in the United States.
[09:28:26 PM] Syed: It can be found on the side of the box in which the device was shipped.
[09:28:54 PM] Jenna: I do not have the box....I bought it in December and most likely did not keep the box.

[09:30:28 PM] Jenna: Yep.

[09:33:42 PM] Jenna: None at all. The phone is in great shape.

[09:34:30 PM] Jenna: Its the one I received in the box

[08:18:00 PM]HH_Jose Dyril: I'm sorry to know that you have issues with your phone, What seems to be the problem with your moto x pure edition?<br />
[08:19:30 PM]Lisa Fusco: 1) Many times emails and other push notifications only arrive a few times a day, noticeably when charging. I've checked all the settings, and push notifications are enabled. This may tie in to problem number 2) which is that MMS messages rarely work on my phone (sending AND receiving). In addition, SMS messages are touchy, and I rarely get the messages I need in a timely fashion, if at all. Strangely, they too sometimes appear to transmit only while charging, thought not always.<br />
[08:20:41 PM]Lisa Fusco: 3) I have a crack in my screen, but it the thin cracks seem to have done damage to the inside and the pixels are dead within a zone near the crack.<br />

[01:21:50 PM]HH_Jose Dyril: Alright! Can you please tell what happened to your phone?<br />
[01:24:05 PM]Tori: so what happened was the apps that already come programmed on the phone i think i accidentally disabled the wrong app on my phone i think i would be the text to speech app i dont see it anymore in my apps but i tried to get it back like my keyboard back and i can't now and it is only speech and i can't even get into my phone now because the speak part doesn't even let me say my passcode to get in it<br />
[01:24:40 PM]Tori: is there anything i can do to fix it?<br />
[01:26:43 PM]HH_Jose Dyril: Yes! For that, You can go to your phone Settings>Apps and then from there you can look for the app that you accidentally disabled<br />
[01:27:22 PM]Tori: i can't get into my phone to do that though i can't get  to my settings<br />
[01:28:46 PM]HH_Jose Dyril: Why? Is your screen not responding?<br />

[11:52:06 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: Thank you.<br />
[11:52:06 AM]Julie Reynolds: From Ting, about a year ago.<br />
[11:53:25 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: Upon checking, the model of your phone is Moto G 1st gen.<br />
[11:53:49 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: For the troubleshooting steps, we can perform safe mode.<br />
[11:54:18 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: Here are the steps:<br />
[11:54:21 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: Safe Mode temporarily disables all applications installed from the Play Store. This troubleshooting step helps determine whether a third party application is the cause of a software issue. Safe Mode should always be tested prior to performing a hard (factory) reset.<br />Tips:<br />• Begin by looking for specific application types such as launchers, task killers or anti-virus apps.<br />• Application icons will still appear the same on the home screen or within the Apps menu. Apps will launch if you select the icon to activate, they will not automatically launch. <br />• You may be required to re-add accounts such as Facebook and LinkedIn after initiating Safe mode. (Settings > + Add Account)<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br /><br />Enable Safe Mode<br />1. Press the Power key until Power off comes up on the screen, then release the Power button.<br />2. Touch and hold Power off on the screen.<br />3. Touch OK when Reboot to Safe Mode appears.<br />4. Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner.<br />5. While in Safe Mode, test if the issue remains. If it does, further troubleshooting is needed. If it doesn't, this means a third party application is causing it.<br />6. Remove the app that causes the problem from the device.<br />
[11:54:20 AM]Julie Reynolds: Ok<br />
[11:56:06 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: Remove an application<br />1. Touch Apps   > Play Store > Menu > My apps.<br />2. Select the application that you want to remove. Tap Uninstall, then confirm by touching OK.<br />3. After you have identified and removed the trouble application, you can disable safe mode by power cycling the device.<br />
[11:56:29 AM]Julie Reynolds: Okay tryIn that now<br />
[11:56:58 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: After performing safe mode, it is advisable to observe your phone within the day.<br />
[11:57:19 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: Would there be anything else?<br />
[11:57:59 AM]HH_Encarnacion Ladia: I will be creating a reference number so if you contact us back, just provide the reference number.<br />

[09:52:25 AM]Karen: I have a Moto G4 Play phone that I originally purchased from Amazon. Since I bought it, the GPS functionality on the phone has seemed to perform erratically. I cannot use it to navigate at all (like with Google Maps or Waze) since the GPS is so unreliable. I'm wondering if it's this specific phone (a hardware problem that could be fixed) or if it's this version of the phone in general.<br />
[09:54:27 AM]HH_Brian Alan: I'm sorry to hear that you are encountering a GPS issue on your Moto G4 Play. May I know when did the issue occur?<br />
[09:56:46 AM]HH_Brian Alan: I noticed you have been away from the chat session for 2 minutes. I’ll stay here until the next minute so I can continue to help you with your concern.<br />
[09:56:50 AM]Karen: I don't know exactly. When I first got the phone, I think it seemed to be working ok, but I wasn't using the phone for navigation that much then. Over the past 2 weeks however, I was on several trips (one to New York City) and one to Vermont, and the phone GPS performance was terrible. I have high location accuracy turned on, and I cleaned the partition cache between the trips to NYC and VT to see if that would improve the navigation performance, and it did get slightly better, but not enough to make it useful.<br />
[09:57:49 AM]Karen: Also - I don't know why you sent the message that I was away from the chat session for 2 minutes. I wasn't away at all.<br />
[09:58:34 AM]Karen: Hello?<br />
[09:59:07 AM]HH_Brian Alan: Have you already tried to do a factory reset?<br />
[09:59:50 AM]Karen: No.  I don't want to do a factory reset unless I know for sure what the problem is, and how that will solve it.<br />
[10:00:22 AM]HH_Brian Alan: Okay then, Lets try to do a factory data reset on your phone.<br />
[10:00:39 AM]Karen: What does that mean?<br />
[10:00:53 AM]HH_Brian Alan: Lets check if that is a software issue, if the factory reset didn't work then it means you are encountering a hardware issue.<br />
[10:01:40 AM]Karen: Will this delete all my user data?<br />
[10:02:19 AM]HH_Brian Alan: Yes, including the settings of the phone, contacts, image, audios.<br />
[10:02:41 AM]Karen: In order to determine why the GPS isn't working?<br />
[10:03:30 AM]HH_Brian Alan: Yes, since you already tried to clear the cache. then that is the next troubleshooting step.<br />
[10:04:40 AM]Karen: Ok. I can't do it now though. I don't have enough time to reset the phone to factory settings and then go through the process of putting all my info back on it. I have to go to a meeting right now. I'll have to find time to do it later today.<br />

720,9302059,Moto Z Play,Bad Sound Quality,"[10:19:57 AM]Hi, my name is Abigail&#46; How may I help you?<br />
[10:21:21 AM]Pa Shaw: Hi Abigail:  I have an issue I'm sure you must be familiar with by now.  I have a brand new Moto Z play and my notifications ring tone is very low even at the loudest setting.  Will there be a fix for this issue soon?<br />
[10:22:15 AM]Abigail: I am sorry to know that your Moto Z play notification sound has a problem but let me assist you and check that for you.<br />
[10:22:14 AM]Pa Shaw: I have tried all of the suggestions on the online ""fix"" menu to no avail.  I have read many forums online regarding this issue and it seems rampant.<br />
[10:23:04 AM]Pa Shaw: I am logged in on the chat thru my computer as I could not get logged in on my phone.  Tried many many times to access the chat on my phone.<br />
[10:23:11 AM]Abigail: May I know what other troubleshooting steps you already done so far?<br />
[10:24:21 AM]Pa Shaw: Used the ""fix"" menu on the phone with no improvement.  Such as checking to be sure blue tooth is turned off, checking the level on my volume settings, doing a recent system update.<br />
[10:24:37 AM]Pa Shaw: Update was done this morning<br />
[10:24:53 AM]Abigail: Have you tried a reset on your phone?<br />
[10:25:03 AM]Pa Shaw: Yes<br />
[10:26:43 AM]Abigail: May I know what reset it is?<br />
[10:27:30 AM]Pa Shaw: I have even asked at the verizon store, they couldn't help.  Checked with kids at work who are very techie and they couldn't figure it out either.  The reset was to reboot the phone.<br />
[10:27:53 AM]Pa Shaw: Is there another way to do a reset?<br />
[10:29:02 AM]Abigail: I see, well our last troubleshooting step here is factory data reset but by doing this you need to back up first your files because by doing this it will wipe out all your files.<br />
[10:30:09 AM]Pa Shaw: This is my first new smart phone.  I have had other smart phones...most recent galaxy s3, but I have not done a file back up before.  Please walk me thru it.<br />
[10:31:59 AM]Abigail: Alright, may I know first what is your carrier?<br />
[10:32:19 AM]Pa Shaw: I checked in my settings and I have it set to automatic restore and ""back up my data"" is set at ON.  My carrier is Verizon<br />
[10:33:05 AM]Abigail: Yes that can do. Thank you for the information.<br />
[10:34:53 AM]Pa Shaw: Do I just click on factory data reset?  I must tell you that when I was at the Verizon store, the rep tried the notifications tones on the phone on display and found the same low tone issue with that one.  So it is not my phone, it is the system.  I assume it is a ploy to get people to buy the speaker mod, which I will not do.<br />
[10:35:59 AM]Abigail: I do apologize for that, in that case we don't have any information.<br />
[10:38:28 AM]Pa Shaw: I must say that is unsatisfactory.  This is a brand new phone, a brand new style phone.  I love the fact that I can add the mods, I got the battery mod with the phone and love it.  But I know that other people have had this same issue with low tones.  Motorola really must find a solution to this even if that solution is to provide all of us with the issue with the speaker mod for free.  This is not a cheap phone and it should work to our satisfaction.<br />
[10:40:50 AM]Pa Shaw: This may even be an issue that should be presented to the attorney general's office as it is a rampant problem with these phones.<br />
[10:41:53 AM]Abigail: I do apologize for that. You may try to do the the factory data reset and if it is still not working then you can contact us again and check the repair options we have here.<br />
[10:44:28 AM]Abigail: Are you still there? We have noticed that you have been ""idle"" for 2 minutes, if no response is sent within the next minute this chat session could be terminated.<br />

[03:22:45 PM]Em: Ok, would rebooting the router help?<br />
[03:23:22 PM]Abigail: You can try it, but to be sure, might as well contact your internet service provider.<br />

[09:24:39 PM] Alexander Foygel: Hi, I have Moto G 2nd generation (XT 1064). Two days ago I started having an issue with BT connection to my car. The phone has been used with that car for a couple of years, and as far as I know, nothing changed. I can pair the phone with the car. If I make a call from the phone, I can see the number I&#39;m dialing on car&#39;s display, but I can&#39;t here anything. I&#39;ve tried pairing another phone with the same car, and that worked fine, so it&#39;s a not a car problem. I&#39;ve tried unpairing Moto G with the car, and then pairing again, but it did not help. I still can use the phone with the car.
[09:24:51 PM] Savanapalli: Kindly give me a minute or two while I review your concern.
[09:25:04 PM] Alexander Foygel: Sorry. &quot; I stil can&#39;t use the phone with the car&quot;.
[09:26:21 PM] Savanapalli: Thank you for your time.
[09:27:19 PM] Savanapalli: As I understand, you are unable to hear other person during call, Correct?
[09:27:32 PM] Alexander Foygel: Yes.
[09:27:50 PM] Savanapalli: Could you please provide me with the IMEI number of your phone? It can be found on the side of the box, under Settings > Phone info > Status, or by dialing *#06# on the main screen of your handset

[09:29:16 PM] Savanapalli: Thank you for providing information.

[09:29:41 PM] Savanapalli: Since how long are you facing this issue?
[09:30:17 PM] Alexander Foygel: Two or three days. Before it worked fine for a couple of years.
[09:30:37 PM] Savanapalli: Were there any changes made to the device recently?
[09:30:44 PM] Alexander Foygel: No that I know of.
[09:31:20 PM] Savanapalli: Is there any physical / liquid damage caused to your device?
[09:31:25 PM] Alexander Foygel: no
[09:31:45 PM] Savanapalli: Have you connected your phone to any other bluetooth enabled device?
[09:32:34 PM] Alexander Foygel: Yes. It works fine with a BT speaker, but it&#39;s a Media profile, not the same used for the phone connection.
[09:33:16 PM] Savanapalli: Please un-pair it from other speaker and connect to your car bluetooth.
[09:33:27 PM] Alexander Foygel: To clarify - I tried connecting to the BT speaker today as part of my troubleshooting. The car connection stopped working two or three days ago.
[09:34:32 PM] Savanapalli: Please unpair your phone and car bluetooth from any other device which are connected to them.
[09:36:14 PM] Alexander Foygel: The car was not paired with any other phones when this Moto G stopped working, and the Moto G was not paired with anything when it stopped working. And I have already tried deleting the phone from the car&#39;s list of phone and adding it back. It pairs with car every time with no problem, but I can&#39;t hear the other side.
[09:37:18 PM] Alexander Foygel: Do you still want me to go through the unparing steps?
[09:38:17 PM] Savanapalli: Please give me a minute or so to research this and get back to you with the Solution?
[09:38:48 PM] Alexander Foygel: OK
[09:40:42 PM] Savanapalli: Thank you for your time.
[09:41:07 PM] Savanapalli: I&#39;d recommend you to reset your car bluetooth and check.
[09:42:09 PM] Alexander Foygel: You mean, delete the phone from the car and then reconnect? I&#39;ve done that earlier today and it did not help. Any other suggestions?
[09:42:49 PM] Savanapalli: No Alexander, Do factory reset on your bluetooth device and try to pair with your phone
[09:43:19 PM] Alexander Foygel: How do I do factory reset on my car BT?
[09:43:52 PM] Savanapalli: You may find the steps on user guide or contact manufacturer.

751,8964388,Moto G (2nd Gen.),Bluetooth - Cannot Pair,"[02:53:43 PM] Hi, my name is Panda. How may I help you?
[02:54:41 PM] End-user: This is a continuation of the chat session that I had 10 min ago with Ashmita, which in turn was a continuation of yesterday&#39;s chat 160813-011192
[02:56:17 PM] Panda: Thank you for being Online
[02:56:22 PM] Panda: I am sorry to hear that. Let me see how we can best resolve this for you
[02:56:32 PM] Panda: Could you please provide me with the IMEI number of your device?
[02:57:10 PM] End-user: It&#39;s in yesterday&#39;s transcript. but here it is again: 359298051459557
[02:57:39 PM] Panda: Thank you for the information.
[02:58:16 PM] Panda: If I understand this correctly you are having trouble connecting the Phone to the car via bluetooth. Am I correct?
[03:00:10 PM] End-user: Yes. After the previous agent suggested to reboot in safe mode, I can at least connect to Moto Roadster (but not to the car yet). How do I keep it working with the Roadster after the reboot? Let&#39;s try making it work with Roadster first.
[03:01:34 PM] Panda: Have you tried clearing the cache partition of the device?
[03:02:06 PM] End-user: Please provide instructions
[03:02:23 PM] Panda: Okay sure,.
[03:03:24 PM] Panda: Please provide me a minute
[03:05:37 PM] Panda: 1-With the phone powered off, press and hold the Volume Down button and the Power button at the same time until the device turns on.
2-Press the Volume Down button to highlight &quot;Recovery mode&quot;
3-Press the Power button to restart into Recovery mode.
4-You&#39;ll see an image of an Android robot with a red exclamation mark.
5-Holding the Power button, tap Volume Up once and then release the Power button.
6-Use the volume buttons to scroll to &quot;wipe cache partition&quot; and press the Power button to select it. (There may be an additional confirmation screen. Volume down to scroll to yes and power to select.
7-&quot;Reboot system now&quot; will be highlighted, press the Power button to select it.
[03:05:51 PM] Panda: Please let me know if you are stuck at any step
[03:08:28 PM] Panda: Are you able to perform the steps?
[03:09:52 PM] End-user: It restarted in a normal mode. I did not see any green robot, with or without an exclamation mark. I saw the stitching pattern, as usual
[03:10:33 PM] Panda: Okay just try it again.
[03:11:14 PM] End-user: OK. Let me try
[03:13:46 PM] End-user: Steps 1 and 2 worked fine. Pressing the Power button (step 3) immediately turns the phone off, but then it does not turn on at all. And if I then press the Power button again, the phone starts as normal
[03:14:25 PM] Panda: You just need to PRESS the POWER button once
[03:14:38 PM] Panda: Holding it will restart the device.
[03:15:58 PM] End-user: I pressed it; I did not hold it. The screen would go blank, but then nothing would happen. I&#39;ve tried it twice. I can try it again - should I?
[03:16:35 PM] Panda: What is the android version running in the device?
[03:17:00 PM] End-user: 6.0
[03:17:18 PM] Panda: Those steps should work
[03:17:49 PM] Panda: Are you sure you are performing the steps corrctly?
[03:18:32 PM] End-user: Yes
[03:19:02 PM] Panda: Okay just power on the device.
[03:20:20 PM] End-user: For some reason my device went in the airplane mode, and now it shows an android icon (a small one) in the top left corner. &nbsp;The icon says &quot;The CommServer has Started&quot;. What is this?
[03:21:21 PM] Panda: Have you selected recovery option there?
[03:21:59 PM] End-user: I think so, but how do I get out of this weir mode now?
[03:22:35 PM] Panda: Okay just restart the Device again
[03:23:33 PM] Panda: Are you still getting that message?
[03:23:47 PM] End-user: let me finish the reboot. I&#39;ll let you know.
[03:24:52 PM] End-user: No. The icon is gone.
[03:25:19 PM] Panda: That&#39;s good
[03:25:29 PM] Panda: Now try again the steps
[03:25:40 PM] End-user: OK
[03:25:49 PM] Panda: Make sure you are selecting the correct option that is RECOVERY.
[03:28:41 PM] End-user: Same behavior. When I press (for a fraction of a second) the Power button in step 3, the screen turns blank right away and nothing happens after that. BTW, Android 6 does not display the green robot during reboot. It displays a fancy stitching pattern instead, so I think your instructions are not for Android 6.
[03:29:17 PM] Panda: In that case I would suggest you to perform a Factory Reset.
[03:30:23 PM] End-user: I don&#39;t want to lose my text messages, so I would need to save them some way. What are the instruction for factory reset?
[03:30:58 PM] Panda: To back up SMS you can this app

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zegoggles.smssync&amp;hl=en
[03:32:04 PM] Panda: You can back up all your text messages
[03:33:20 PM] End-user: OK. Once I have done this - how do I do Factory reset?
[03:34:09 PM] Panda: You can go to

Settings>>Back up and reset>>Factory Reset>>Reset Phone
[03:37:26 PM] Panda: Are you still there? We have noticed that you have been &quot;idle&quot; for 2 minutes, if no response is sent within the next minute this chat session could be terminated.

[03:38:53 PM] End-user: Can I don Network Setting Reset instead? Also, please generate incident ID for this chat session so that I can reference it later once I will have performed the reset.
[03:38:59 PM] End-user: Yes
[03:39:32 PM] End-user: This was my last response: &quot;Can I don Network Setting Reset instead? Also, please generate incident ID for this chat session so that I can reference it later once I will have performed the reset&quot;
[03:40:10 PM] Panda: Yes you can try that.
[03:40:21 PM] Panda: Okay lets try with that
[03:41:34 PM] End-user: So, do you want me to do Network Setting Reset ?
[03:42:09 PM] Panda: Go to

Settings>>Back up and reset>>Network settings>>Reset Network Settings
[03:44:17 PM] Panda: Are we connected?
[03:45:05 PM] End-user: It works fine with Roadster. I can go and try with the car, but it takes 5 min and by that time the char will be disconnected. Please provide me with the incident ID for this chat.
[03:45:36 PM] Panda: Yes it is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 160814-003820

[02:08:56 PM] Daniel Bradley: on off, both devices. back on. still not found
[02:09:19 PM] Savanapalli: I understand. I would request you to try to connect your phone with any other bluetooth to isolate the issue whether it is a bluetooth or phoen issue
[02:09:42 PM] Daniel Bradley: moto wants to make money off of products that have so many problems. none of you companies know what you&#39;re doing
[02:09:56 PM] Daniel Bradley: we only have two blue tooth devices.
[02:10:05 PM] Daniel Bradley: both were connected to previous phones yeasterday
[02:10:19 PM] Daniel Bradley: both were UNPAIRED from those phones yesterday.

[02:16:22 PM] Savanapalli: Check your bluetooth headset user guide for reset details.
[02:16:41 PM] Daniel Bradley: these were working yesterday. I don&#39;t get this
[02:17:18 PM] Savanapalli: They were working but in order to pair with the new device, you will need to reset the bluetooth device first
[02:18:01 PM] Daniel Bradley: no directions on how to reset in the &quot;get started in under 5 guide.&quot; no other paperwork included with device
[02:18:54 PM] Savanapalli: In this scenario, I&#39;d recommend you to contact your headset manufacturer for reset details.
[02:19:24 PM] Daniel Bradley: everyone always recommends someone else deal with it. good bye, thanks for trying, please tell someone at moto you&#39;re just another company that stinks

[05:41:10 PM]Steven Schnedler: I am horribly frustrated with my new G Plus when it comes to downloading pictures from it to my computer. Any other phone I have used, I just plug in the USB cable, it appears in IE and I copy or move. This phone appears in IE but cannot find pictures in the software that pops up. I have monkeyed with it in the past and something appears on the phone that gives me the option to copy over, but it is not appearing now.<br />
[05:41:44 PM]Steven Schnedler: I need to be able to just plug my phone in to my computer with the USB, it appear in IE like any other drive and copy, move or whatever. What do I need to do to be able to do this?<br />

[05:45:07 PM]Steven Schnedler: Thanks, I really have been frustrated. I spent a month in Mexico and could not get international data on it. I spent time on Motorola chat. Motorola blamed Sprint and Sprint blamed Motorola. In the meantime, I didn't get service. Now this. I appreciate your help.<br />
[05:45:52 PM]Steven Schnedler: By the way, I had the save results with the pictures on three different computers, so I know the problem is not the computer.<br />

[05:59:47 PM]Steven Schnedler: Okay, it says it is searching for pix now, hasn't found any so far.<br />
[06:00:56 PM]Steven Schnedler: Why go through this step? The phone icon appears in IE. Why not just make it so it can open up like every other company's icons, like a HD, so one can transfer or copy or whatever. What is the point of having this extra step? It still has not found any pix.<br />
[06:02:44 PM]Steven Schnedler: Should I pick File or Photo transfer?<br />
[06:03:46 PM]Steven Schnedler: Okay, photo transfer doesn't work at all and file didn't seem to find any photos. I will try it again.<br />
[06:04:20 PM]HH_Jose Dyril: Alright! It's good to know that you were able to find the USB notification. It's actually part of the security features of the New Marshmallow update to avoid inadvertent deleting of files.<br />

[02:33:20 PM]Harsha Kenche: its internal memory is 16GB, but I do have a microSD card which I formatted as internal memory<br />

[02:38:10 PM]Harsha Kenche: I've already tried that, not all apps were moved, a few were<br />
[02:38:57 PM]Anna: I see, the other apps on the phone especially those pre installed or pre downloaded apps can not be transfer to SD card.<br />
[02:39:19 PM]Anna: What I can suggest is to do a Clear Cache Partition on your phone.<br />
[02:39:50 PM]Harsha Kenche: A few of the pre-installed apps, and also some of the apps downloaded from the play store are installed on internal memory<br />
[02:41:03 PM]Anna: I see, in this case let's do the Clear Cache Partition and after we do this, try transferring the applications to the SD card.<br />
[02:41:27 PM]Anna: To begin, may I have the IMEI number of the phone? Please go to Settings > About phone > Status > IMEI/MEID information. Or if you still have the box of the phone, kindly locate for the IMEI/MEID that normally starts with 99000, 35 or A000.<br />

[02:46:11 PM]Anna: Thank you for the information, Harsha.<br />
[02:47:01 PM]Harsha Kenche: My main concern is if I am trying to install a new app, it is trying to install in the on-board memory portion, even though the SD card was formatted to be used as ""internal memory""<br />
[02:48:13 PM]Anna: I see, you can also adjust the setting on the Play Store, so that the apps you've installed will be saved on the SD card.<br />
[02:48:34 PM]Harsha Kenche: can you please let me know how?<br />
[02:48:40 PM]Anna: Doing a Clear Cache Partition will removed all temporary files on the phone, releases the caches.<br />
[02:49:25 PM]Anna: Just go to Play Store, Swipe Left and you will see there the Settings.<br />
[02:49:47 PM]Anna: Touch the Settings, and it will lead you to where you want to adjust the settings.<br />

[09:26:50 PM]Susan Bennett: I do it regularly through a couple of online backups, but I’ve been so busy the past week I haven’t gotten around to it. So there’s no way to do the repairs without a reset?<br />
[09:28:32 PM]HH_John Michael: I cannot guarantee that our ware house people will not do a reset on your device, because that’s what they are normally doing.<br />
[09:30:42 PM]HH_John Michael: Just to ask Susan, how about on the SD card on your device, is there important files that was saved on your External Storage?<br />

[09:33:28 PM]HH_John Michael: Yes I do understand that one, just remove the SD card from your phone and try to insert it to another device.<br />

[09:17:56 AM] Panda: Okay
[09:18:03 AM] Jack de Koning: The account is no longer known, how do I go about resetting the device to&quot; first user&quot; ?
[09:18:55 AM] Panda: Is that a old device you are using or you bought it new?
[09:19:28 AM] Jack de Koning: it&#39;s been used previously
[09:20:09 AM] Jack de Koning: But the user has left the company

[09:23:47 AM] Jack de Koning: hmm, I don&#39;t have the box and I am at the set-up screen where it asks me to enter the google account, so I can&#39;t check settings or dial *#06#. &nbsp;Is it wrtten underneath the cover?

[09:26:49 AM] Jack de Koning: correct
[09:27:43 AM] Panda: Actually you need to find a way to contact the previous user
[09:27:54 AM] Panda: Or you have to send the device to us for repair
[09:27:54 AM] Jack de Koning: Really?
[09:28:25 AM] Jack de Koning: hmm, that makes no sense tbh
[09:28:36 AM] Panda: you have to send the device to us for repair
[09:29:26 AM] Jack de Koning: We use the MotoG as a corporate device, so if users leave and we want to allocate this phone to someone else, we can&#39;t just wipe it, we have to send it in for repair?
[09:30:05 AM] Panda: Yes the device software needs to be flashed
[09:31:00 AM] Jack de Koning: I have a MotoG 1st gen, which doesn&#39;t have this feature, so is this something that was introduced with the 3rd gen one?
[09:31:27 AM] Panda: Yes it is called as a Kill Switch
[09:31:52 AM] Jack de Koning: Yes, it certainly is
[09:32:55 AM] Panda: Sorry but you have to send the device to us

[10:04:25 AM] Lisa: I have a Motorola droid 4 XT894 of which the soft keys/navigation keys are not working. &nbsp;They still light up but do not function.
[10:05:07 AM] Wankhadae: I am sorry to hear that. Let me see how we can best resolve this for you.
[10:05:13 AM] Wankhadae: How long have you been experiencing this issue?
[10:05:18 AM] Lisa: I can not go back on the phone, only turn it off and on to return to a certain screen
[10:05:39 AM] Lisa: 2 days for the keys, but longer for problems with the phone.
[10:06:48 AM] Lisa: Verizon eliminated the voicemail app, without public notification. &nbsp;Verizon &nbsp;staff worked on the phone, and it has been a little messed up since.

[10:10:09 AM] Lisa: I will try this.

[10:12:05 AM] Lisa: Ok.
[10:12:26 AM] Wankhadae: Before that you have to back up your data.
[10:13:06 AM] Lisa: I have the instructions for that. &nbsp;I think I just erased all of my data clearing the internal storage any way. &nbsp;Thank you.

[02:23:51 PM] Shawn: My google dictionary has been corrupted and it is saved in the cloud.
[02:24:53 PM] Shawn: One example (there are many more), I type &quot;id&quot; into the text box and the keyboard will change this to &quot;Ii&#39;d&quot;. No matter what I do I cannot fix this except to go back and change the correction manually
[02:25:17 PM] Shawn: I cannot find anywhere to &quot;reset&quot; the dictionary data on my google account
[02:25:27 PM] Shirisha: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.

[10:28:19 AM] Patricia: I have a Moto 4 that I bought in July that is barely functional

[10:29:32 AM] Patricia: Basically, it frequently acts as though one spot on the screen is being pushed. So whatever I&#39;m doing is interrupted and it won&#39;t let me operate the phone. Usually if I put it to sleep for a couple of minutes I can resume, but the problem is getting more frequent and that fix is working less.
[10:30:01 AM] Patricia: The screen is in pristine condition and it has not been dropped, dunked, or otherwise injured.

Thank you for providing the information.
[10:31:04 AM] Asmita: As I understand there is a spot on the device. Am I right?
[10:31:22 AM] Patricia: Yes, it&#39;s always the same spot on the top left quadrant.
[10:31:37 AM] Asmita: Is there any physical or liquid damage to the device?
[10:31:43 AM] Patricia: Zero damage.
[10:32:03 AM] Asmita: Have you installed updates before this issue started??
[10:32:22 AM] Patricia: Yes, this started right after the last major operating system update a few weeks ago.
[10:32:36 AM] Asmita: Okay.
[10:32:57 AM] Asmita: I suggest you to check the device in safe mode. Here are the steps ;- 1. &nbsp;Press the Power key

2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off

3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears

4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner.
[10:33:04 AM] Asmita: I suggest you to tap and hold on power off pop up till another pop up arises reboot to safe mode.
[10:33:37 AM] Patricia: Do what?
[10:33:46 AM] Asmita: 1. &nbsp;Press the Power key

2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off

3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears

4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner.

[10:36:22 AM] Patricia: oh, got it
[10:36:26 AM] Asmita: Pop up on the display.

[10:37:33 AM] Asmita: Okay does the spot is seen?
[10:38:00 AM] Patricia: Am I waiting to see if the problem recurs? It&#39;s not a constant
[10:38:12 AM] Asmita: Okay.
[10:39:00 AM] Patricia: If it doesn&#39;t recur, what does that mean? And if it does recur?
[10:40:02 AM] Asmita: It means that some third party app is interrupting the device.As we cannot predict which app, is interrupting.
[10:40:35 AM] Patricia: What does it mean if the problem recurs in safe mode?
[10:41:20 AM] Asmita: I suggest you to turn off the device and on it again and check.
[10:42:13 AM] Patricia: It may take a while for me to determine if the problem is still there. I can go hours with no issues, then there will be hours where I can&#39;t use my phone at all.
[10:42:40 AM] Asmita: I suggest you to power off the device and turn it on again and check
[10:42:51 AM] Asmita: Can you see the spot.
[10:43:09 AM] Patricia: That&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to determine what the two different outcomes mean:
1. The problem is gone in safe mode. Then I guess I just start deleting apps until it&#39;s gone?
2. The problem is still there in safe mode. Then what?
[10:43:55 AM] Asmita: If the problem is there in safe mode you need to perform reset.
[10:44:11 AM] Patricia: How do I do that?
[10:44:40 AM] Asmita: Unfortunately you will lose the data on device.

804,9045163,Moto X Pure Edition,Power Cycles,"[06:37:23 PM] Hi, my name is Sunku. How may I help you?
[06:38:25 PM] Mary: Hi Sunku, I&#39;m calling to find out if there&#39;s anything I can do about mt Moto X Pure edition rebooting itself all of a sudden. It does it sometimes more than once a day, and usually when I&#39;m not actually using it.
[06:38:59 PM] Sunku: Hello Mary. &nbsp;
[06:39:24 PM] Sunku: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this
[06:40:10 PM] Sunku: Only for qualities purposes, could you please verify your email and the location where the device was purchased(country) before we go any further?
[06:40:57 PM] Mary: Thanks. &nbsp;My email address is marygraybaker@gmail.com. &nbsp;I bought the device online in the USA. I&#39;m running Android 6.0 (I got the update to Marshmallow). I don&#39;t think the problem was happening before the update, but I&#39;m not totally sure since the phone is pretty new so I got the update pretty much right away.
[06:41:45 PM] Sunku: Oh! I am sorry to hear that.
[06:41:52 PM] Sunku: Thank you for the information.
[06:43:00 PM] Sunku: As I understand that your device Moto x pure is facing issue with random restarting. Am I right?
[06:43:08 PM] Mary: Yes, that&#39;s right.
[06:43:41 PM] Sunku: Okay, Is there any Physical or liquid damage to the device?
[06:43:52 PM] Mary: No, the device is pretty much brand new.
[06:44:03 PM] Sunku: How long have you been experiencing this issue?
[06:44:26 PM] Mary: For several weeks. I think since I accepted the Marshmallow update.
[06:44:50 PM] Mary: My husband has the same phone and he&#39;s been having the same problem, although not as often as I get it.
[06:45:40 PM] Sunku: Okay, Have you tried any troubleshooting previously?
[06:46:08 PM] Mary: I looked online at your troubleshooting page, but it had no information about random restarts.
[06:47:12 PM] Sunku: Okay, I would suggest you check the device in safe mode.

1. &nbsp;Press the Power key
2. &nbsp;Touch and hold Power off
3. &nbsp;Touch OK when Reboot to safe mode appears
4. &nbsp;Phone will reboot and Safe Mode will appear in bottom left corner
[06:47:57 PM] Sunku: Please check the device in safe mode for a day and check if you still face the same issue in safe mode.
[06:47:58 PM] Mary: Okay, I&#39;ll do that. I should also mention that on the following web page it says many customers are experiencing the same problem, just in case that&#39;s useful to know: http://www.gottabemobile.com/2015/12/23/moto-x-android-6-0-update-problems-fixes/
[06:48:40 PM] Mary: Could I ask you what safe mode means?
[06:50:15 PM] Sunku: Safe mode starts the device without any 3rd party applications being started. It is used to troubleshoot issues. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, this indicates a 3rd party application is the culprit.
[06:50:45 PM] Sunku: We request you not to trust third party sites.
[06:51:11 PM] Mary: Okay, thanks very much. It has rebooted in safe mode and I&#39;ll run it that way and see if that fixes the problem. If it *does* fix the problem, do I then try to figure out which app is causing the problem?
[06:51:33 PM] Sunku: Yes.
[06:51:40 PM] Mary: Because I might start the bad app while in safe mode without knowing it&#39;s the bad app!
[06:52:53 PM] Sunku: Please uninstall one by one application and check for the issue.
[06:53:09 PM] Mary: Okay, thank you. I&#39;ll do that. You&#39;ve been very helpful.
[06:53:55 PM] Sunku: If you still face the same issue in safe mode, Then I would suggest you to perform factory data reset. This will surely help you in resolving the issue.
[06:54:05 PM] Sunku: To reset your device:
1. Touch Menu
2. Touch Settings
3. Touch Backup &amp; reset
4. Touch Factory Data Reset
5. Touch Reset Phone
[06:54:21 PM] Sunku: Please back up the data before you perform reset.this will delete everything that was installed or imported to internal memory in the device.
[06:54:39 PM] Mary: Okay, I&#39;ll do that if the other doesn&#39;t fix the problem, and I&#39;ll be sure to do a backup first.
[06:54:59 PM] Sunku: That&#39;s great Mary. &nbsp;
[06:55:04 PM] Sunku: Is there anything else I may assist you with today?
[06:55:20 PM] Mary: No, that&#39;s it. Thanks again!
[06:55:38 PM] Sunku: I appreciate the time you have taken to chat with us.I hope you were satisfied by my service.
[06:56:12 PM] Mary: Yes, thanks. I&#39;ll happily answer any survey that pops up afterward :-)
[06:56:33 PM] Sunku: You will be presented with a small survey at the end of this chat by E-mail.
As I really value any feedback about how well I have helped you today,
I hope you don&#39;t mind taking a couple of minutes to complete this.
[06:56:41 PM] Sunku: Thank Mary. &nbsp;

[08:55:31 PM] Emily Kretz: Hello, my phone refuses to turn on. I tried a few troubleshooting things but they aren&#39;t working. This is the second time this has happened in the past 6 weeks, first time I had to do a full factory reboot and I&#39;d rather not do that again, and I&#39;ve had the phone less than a year
[08:56:31 PM] Savanapalli: I am really sorry for the inconvenience this has caused. Let me see how we can best resolve this
[08:56:37 PM] Savanapalli: To help me better understand the issue, I need to collect some information. Is that OK with you?

[08:57:13 PM] Savanapalli: Thank you for providing information.
[08:57:59 PM] Savanapalli: As I understand, your phone is not turning on, Am I correct?
[08:58:11 PM] Emily Kretz: yea
[08:58:31 PM] Savanapalli: Since when did this issue start?
[08:59:04 PM] Emily Kretz: It started this afternoon. At first it would turn on for a minute and then shut off, and now it just won&#39;t turn on
[08:59:09 PM] Savanapalli: Did you install any updates/applications before this issue started?
[08:59:36 PM] Emily Kretz: Nothing other than the automatic updates
[09:00:02 PM] Savanapalli: Is there any physical or liquid damage?
[09:00:16 PM] Emily Kretz: No
[09:00:30 PM] Savanapalli: Did you checked the device by connecting the charger whether it is charging or not?
[09:01:24 PM] Emily Kretz: I&#39;ve plugged it in, but nothing shows up for charging. When I tried the troubleshooting, it said the battery was ok
[09:01:31 PM] Savanapalli: Have you tried any troubleshooting previously?
[09:02:30 PM] Emily Kretz: ive tried a few things
[09:02:37 PM] Savanapalli: Let&#39;s follow a few troubleshooting steps which should help us resolve this.
[09:02:59 PM] Emily Kretz: ok sounds good
[09:03:01 PM] Savanapalli: Connect the device to charger and try force restarting (Press and hold power key for 15 seconds) the device
[09:04:18 PM] Savanapalli: Is your phone turned on?
[09:04:49 PM] Emily Kretz: sorry, just a second
[09:05:00 PM] Savanapalli: No problem.
[09:07:21 PM] Emily Kretz: It goes through the logos, but it then shuts off without actually turning on&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
[09:07:32 PM] Savanapalli: Connect the charger and leave the device for half an hour and try restarting the device
[09:08:33 PM] Savanapalli: It sounds it doesn&#39;t have enough battery percentage to turn on.
[09:09:25 PM] Emily Kretz: I&#39;ll try, but this exact thing has happened before and it had nothing to do with the battery.
[09:10:21 PM] Savanapalli: I understand, I hope your device will be turned on once you charge it.
[09:11:36 PM] Emily Kretz: Thank you for your help. I was wondering, if it&#39;s not the battery, I don&#39;t think this should keep happening. I haven&#39;t had the phone that long. Is there anything I could try to prevent it or what are my options?
[09:12:13 PM] Savanapalli: Yes, if the device turned on, no need to try anything else. If it doesn&#39;t, try to do external reset.
[09:12:25 PM] Savanapalli: You are most welcome
[09:12:27 PM] Emily Kretz: ok thank you

However, on the older phones, we got little visible notifications on the home screen when there were new texts or emails. I can't find a way to make that happen on our new phones.

[02:20:29 PM]a: First the new with the new Moto app I don't have the driving mode anymore.
